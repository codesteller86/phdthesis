abstract = {Fuzzy logic systems are widely used in literature for heuristic knowledge based system operation. However most of these systems operate on multiple input to provide a single output. In this paper we have introduced a scheme for implementation of single input single output (SISO) fuzzy logic approximation of PI controller to control a two input single output (TISO) system. In most systems controlled by PI or PID controllers, there exists to input variable namely error (e) and change in error ($\Delta$e). However, there exists an opportunity to view these controllers as SISO system as $\Delta$ e = f(e), hence it is eventually resource effective to approximate these controllers using single input fuzzy variable. This paper introduces this concept and implements it on a model of Automatic Cruise Control (ACC) in an inclined plane with effect of multiple disturbance forces.},

abstract = {A Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) is designed with heuristic knowledge of the plant. There are several application based Fuzzy Logic Controllers in literature. However, application specific controllers lack reusability and are expensive, if not produced in bulk. This paper presents a general purpose and easily configurable fuzzy logic based controller which can work with 4 inputs and generates a control action based on the knowledge base. Expert operator knowledge can also be directly programmed into the knowledge base (also known as rule base) of the designed controller without ceasing the control operation. The ease of file handling and user interactivity of DSP processors is heavily exploited and TMS320C6713 DSP was chosen as the hardware platform. Further this paper also analyses the system performance with reference to the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox of Matlab. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Residue number system (RNS) is generally an integer number system. The foremost canonical reason for implementation of filter in residue arithmetic is the inherent property of carry-free addition, subtraction and multiplication. As a result we add, subtract and multiply in unison regardless to the numbers. Hereby, devices operating in this principle are fast and ingest low power. However, principal limitation of Residue Number System is the slow and complex nature for arithmetic operations viz. division, comparison, sign detection and overflow detection and rejection. In this paper we have described some novel approaches to grapple with the limitations of comparison, sign detection and averting overflow. The selection of moduli in RNS is most important in attaining to solutions of problems as described earlier. Accordingly, a set of moduli is selected. Further in this paper we have used this set of moduli to successfully depict a design approach for 32-bit lowpass finite impulse response (FIR) filter.},
