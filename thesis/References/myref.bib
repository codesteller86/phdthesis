In this study, a fuzzy stochastic moving-average model with control input (fuzzy ARMAX model) is introduced to describe nonlinear stochastic systems. From the fuzzy ARMAX model, a fuzzy one-step ahead prediction model is developed. Based on a fuzzy one-step ahead prediction stochastic model, optimal design algorithms are proposed to achieve the optimal tracking of nonlinear stochastic systems. In this study, the minimum variance tracking control, generalized minimum variance tracking control, and the optimal model reference tracking control are developed for stochastic fuzzy systems. We construct some basic stability conditions for general stochastic fuzzy systems and use these conditions to verify the stability of the fuzzy tracking control systems. Finally, two simulation examples are given to indicate the performance of the proposed methods.},

Due to different acquisition methods of geospatial data, new problem cases arise in data integration systems and thus the complexity of the integration approach increases. There are many data homogenization methods, which determine the assignment of objects via semantic similarity. The algorithms for polygonal geospatial data integration, presented in this paper, are based on geometrical comparison between two datasets. The objective of these algorithms is the assignment of geospatial elements representing the same object in heterogeneous datasets. Depending on semantic information in geospatial data the polygonal shapes have different spatial extent. For this reason two kinds of polygonal geospatial data were analyzed.

We propose a two-phase learning procedure for this network. The first phase is a error-backprop (EBP) training, and the second phase is a rule pruning. Since some functions of the nodes in the FNN have the competitive characteristics, the EBP training will converge quickly. After the training, a pruning process is performed to delete redundant rules for obtaining a concise fuzzy rule base. Simulation results show that for the truck backer-upper control problem, the training phase learns the knowledge of fuzzy rules in several dozen epochs with an error rate of less than 1\%. Moreover, the fuzzy rule base generated by the pruning process contains only 14\% of the initial fuzzy rules and is identical to the target fuzzy rule base.},

abstract = {In this study, we introduce a new type of coherence membership function to describe fuzzy concepts, which builds upon the theoretical findings of the Axiomatic Fuzzy Set (AFS) theory. This type of membership function embraces both the factor of fuzziness (by capturing subjective imprecision) and randomness (by referring to the objective uncertainty) and treats both of them in a consistent manner. Furthermore we propose a method to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier using coherence membership functions. Given the theoretical developments presented there, the resulting classification systems are referred to as AFS classifiers. The proposed algorithm consists of three major steps: (a) generating fuzzy decision trees by assuming some level of specificity (detailed view) quantified in terms of threshold; (b) pruning the obtained rule-base; and (c) determining the optimal threshold resulting in a final tree. Compared with other fuzzy classifiers, the AFS classifier exhibits several essential advantages being of practical relevance. In particular, the relevance of classification results is quantified by associated confidence levels. Furthermore the proposed algorithm can be applied to data sets with mixed data type attributes. We have experimented with various data commonly present in the literature and compared the results with that of SVM, KNN, C4.5, Fuzzy Decision Trees (FDTs), Fuzzy SLIQ Decision Tree (FS-DT), FARC-HD and FURIA. It has been shown that the accuracy is higher than that being obtained by other methods. The results of statistical tests supporting comparative analysis show that the proposed algorithm performs significantly better than FDTs, FS-DT, KNN and C4.5.},

abstract = {TakagiâSugenoâKang (TSK) fuzzy systems have been widely applied for solving function approximation and regression-centric problems. Existing dynamic TSK models proposed in the literature can be broadly classified into two classes. Class I TSK models are essentially fuzzy systems that are limited to time-invariant environments. Class II TSK models are generally evolving systems that can learn in time-variant environments. This paper attempts to address the issues of achieving compact, up-to-date fuzzy rule bases and interpretable knowledge bases in TSK models. It proposes a novel rule pruning method which is simple, computationally efficient and biologically plausible. This rule pruning algorithm applies a gradual forgetting approach and adopts the Hebbian learning mechanism behind the long-term potentiation phenomenon in the brain. It also proposes a merging approach which is used to improve the interpretability of the knowledge bases. This approach can prevent derived fuzzy sets from expanding too many times to protect their semantic meanings. These two approaches are incorporated into a generic self-evolving TakagiâSugenoâKang fuzzy framework (GSETSK) which adopts an online data-driven incremental-learning-based approach. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed GSETSK against other established evolving TSK systems. GSETSK has also been tested on real world dataset using the high-way traffic flow density and Dow Jones index time series. The results are encouraging. GSETSK demonstrates its fast learning ability in time-variant environments. In addition, GSETSK derives an up-to-date and better interpretable fuzzy rule base while maintaining a high level of modeling accuracy at the same time.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach to dynamically manage the traffic lights cycles and phases in an isolated intersection. The target of the work is a system that, comparing with previous solutions, offers improved performance, is flexible and can be implemented on off-the-shelf components. The challenge here is to find an effective design that achieves the target while avoiding complex and computationally expensive solutions, which would not be appropriate for the problem at hand and would impair the practical applicability of the approach in real scenarios. The proposed solution is a traffic lights dynamic control system that combines an IEEE 802.15.4 Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) for real-time traffic monitoring with multiple fuzzy logic controllers, one for each phase, that work in parallel. Each fuzzy controller addresses vehicles turning movements and dynamically manages both the phase and the green time of traffic lights. The proposed system combines the advantages of the WSN, such as easy deployment and maintenance, flexibility, low cost, noninvasiveness, and scalability, with the benefits of using four parallel fuzzy controllers, i.e., better performance, fault-tolerance, and support for phase-specific management. Simulation results show that the proposed system outperforms other solutions in the literature, significantly reducing the vehicles waiting times. A proof-of-concept implementation on an off-the-shelf device proves that the proposed controller does not require powerful hardware and can be easily implemented on a low-cost device, thus paving the way for extensive usage in practice.},

abstract = {Due to the complex structure of IT2 FLCs, using them in real-time applications might be computationally expensive. To facilitate real-time implementation of these controllers, hardware with parallel processing abilities are recommended; field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) are one class of such hardware. In this paper, we design and implement three different inference mechanisms of IT2 FLCs on hardware. These engines include KarnikâMendel (KM) algorithms, WuâMendel (WM) uncertainty bounds, Nie-Tan (NT) and BiglarbegianâMelekâMendel (BMM) which have recently been introduced in the literature. We first demonstrate how the proposed structures of the IT2 FLCs can be implemented on software; next, we propose architectures for implementing these IT2 FLCs on hardware. We performed simulations to compare the performance of the IT2 FLCs. To assess the controllers performance in real-time we used four indicators; the number of DSP48A1s, MUXCYs, slice registers and slice LUTs. It was shown that the NT and BMM controllers require significantly fewer resources compared to the other engines. While the controller that uses KM as its inference engine uses fewer resources in terms of DSP48A1s, it consumes a considerable amount of other resources compared to the WM controller. Finally, the transient responses of the controllers in terms of rise time and settling time were compared. It was found that the controllers with NT and BMM inference engines have faster closed-loop response in comparison to the one using the WM and KM. The results presented herein provides researchers and engineers a better insight into designing the most suitable IT2 FLCs, and hence it is expected IT2 FLCs can be implemented on hardware to further enable applications on plants requiring fast response (or ultimately real-time implementation).},

It is built up on a single input fuzzy-logic (SIFLC), and based on the constant voltage algorithm. The SIFLC generates a duty cycle (D) signal which is the control one for the DCâDC Boost converter. The proposed SIFLC performances will be compared to these of the well-known P\&O algorithm. A stability study for the Mamdani SIFLC controllers is performed and proposed. The Lyapunov method is considered for the stability analysis of the proposed control systems. This MPPT algorithm is then experimentally implemented all around a DSP1104 for a real-time driving. The obtained results show that the proposed SIFLC-MPPT clearly succeeds to track the maximum power point and shows a higher performance than regular MPPTs such as the P\&O algorithm. Results of the experimental tests also prove the validity and robustness of the proposed overall PV system control scheme.},

abstract = {This paper describes the application of Takagi-Sugeno (TS)-type fuzzy logic controller to a three-phase shunt active power filter for the power-quality improvement and reactive power compensation required by a nonlinear load. The advantage of fuzzy logic control is that it does not require a mathematical model of the system. The application of the Mamdani-type fuzzy logic controller to a three-phase shunt active power filter was investigated earlier but it has the limitation of a larger number of fuzzy sets and rules. Therefore, it needs to optimize a large number of coefficients, which increases the complexity of the controller. On the other hand, TS fuzzy controllers are quite general in that they use arbitrary input fuzzy sets, any type of fuzzy logic, and the general defuzzifier. Moreover, the TS fuzzy controller could be designed by using a lower number of rules and classes. Further, in this paper, the hysteresis current control mode of operation is implemented for pulsewidth-modulation switching signal generation. Computer simulation results show that the dynamic behavior of the TS fuzzy controller is better than the conventional proportional-integral (PI) controller and is found to be more robust to changes in load and other system parameters compared to the conventional PI controller.

abstract = {Iterative learning control (ILC) is a new domain in control system that motivates, whether mechanical robots can learn a prescribed ideal motion by themselves using information represented by the measured data gathered in the previous practice. For each new desired trajectory task, the conventional ILC methods have to start its learning with zero initial input assumption. Instead of such zero initial input assumption, in this paper, the idea of using the past trajectory tracking experiences on the initial input selection for tracking new trajectory-tracking tasks have been highlighted. Certain methods of experience inclusion in iterative learning controllers (ILC) are proposed. Approximate fuzzy data model (AFDM) and type-1 fuzzy logic system (FLS) techniques have been adopted for the process of initial input selection. Performance of the proposed fuzzy rule based model-based ILC approaches on initial error reduction and in error convergence issues are proved. Numerical experimentation on a two-link manipulator model with the inclusion of actuator dynamics verifies the performance of the proposed fuzzy model-based ILC approaches. Comparison with existing local learning technique on the selection of initial input for ILC algorithm proves the efficacy of the proposed AFDM and type-1 FLS-based methods. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this paper we describe a control method for longitudinal ventilation of road tunnels. The proposed method consists of two main elements: (a) prediction of a number of jet-fans and (b) fuzzy control of pollutant levels. Based on measurements of traffic intensity and weather conditions and by knowing tunnel parameters, production of carbon monoxide, nitrite oxides and small particles (soot) is predicted. Estimated values of pollutants are then used for calculation of fresh air volume demand, i.e. required air flow is determined. One-dimensional force equation is used for estimation of a number of jet-fans that would produce a thrust force sufficient to provide calculated air flow. In the same time a fuzzy controller compares measured and admissible levels of pollutants and adjusts a predicted number of jet-fans in order to keep the pollutant levels within predefined boundaries. The proposed method is tested by simulation and obtained results are compared with a method currently used in the ventilation system of the tunnel Ucka. Finally, the field results, obtained by implementation of the proposed control method, are also presented at the end of the paper. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A parameter-dependent polynomial fuzzy model is proposed to represent a non-linear plant. A parameter-dependent polynomial fuzzy controller is then employed to stabilise the non-linear plant. The stability of PDPFMB control systems is investigated using the sum-of-squares (SOS) technique based on a parameter-dependent Lyapunov function candidate. With the consideration of the information of system parameters, parameter-dependent SOS-based stability conditions are obtained to determine the system stability and polynomial feedback gains. A feasible solution to the stability conditions can be obtained numerically using the third-party Matlab toolbox SOSTOOLS. Unlike the membership functions, as the system parameters are not single signed functions, the traditional analysis approach obtaining the stability conditions cannot be applied. Instead, the membership functions and system parameters are considered as symbolic variables for the construction of the parameter-dependent SOS-based stability conditions.

abstract = {An in situ study of the separation of a toluene-benzaldehyde mixture using a microdistillation chip with a serpentine microchannel 600$\mu$m wide and 400. mm long, was performed. Micropillars were incorporated along both sides of the serpentine microchannel to guide liquid flow by induced capillary force. Temperature and concentration profiles were obtained by an infrared imaging camera and in situ Raman spectroscopy. It was found that the separation occurred within a limited section of the chip, the length of which was affected by the heating and cooling temperatures. At the operating conditions studied, the separation was equivalent to 0.9-2.7 equilibrium stages, assuming total reflux. The operation of the microdistillation chip was constrained by hydrodynamics when the array of micropillars could not accommodate the liquid flow completely, thus leading to slug formation, which caused adverse effects on the separation. This work demonstrated that techniques such as Raman spectroscopy, thermal imaging and optical microscopy are efficient tools to provide insight into the operation of microdistillation, and to enable optimization of its design and operation.

The TSP problem uses an order-based chromosome representation (permutation of n objects), while the SCP uses bit strings. The user has numerous buttons to select the GA parameters. These include (a) type of initial population: random or from a file, (b) mode: steady-state or generational, (c) population size, (d) maximum number of generations or trials, (e) generation gap, (f) selection mode, (g) selection bias, (h) selection of the crossover operation from a choice of several possibilities, (i) mutation method, (j) mutation rate, (k) replacement method, (l), elitism, etc. The user has the ability to do a step by step execution or to do a continuous run. The screen layout provides visual representation of the chromosomes in the population with the ability to scroll. This gives the user the option of varying one or two GA parameters to visually see the effect on the algorithm. One of most important features of this tutorial is the set of help screens that explain, with examples, all of the options for each of the GA parameters.

abstract = {An effective method, adaptive fuzzy sliding-mode (SM) PI Control to design full-bridge inverter is proposed in this paper. For practical applications, sliding mode control (SMC) with chattering phenomenon is a large hindrance. The modified model of the PI controller is built by the plant extension scheme, in order to relieve the chattering. Also, the fuzzy logic is applied to find the appropriate parameter values of the PI controller, and can adapt to plant parameter variations and external load disturbances. The proposed method has been realized for the actual full-bridge inverters controlled by DSP and CPLD. Simulation and experimental results of the closed-loop system show that the proposed method yields system performance improvement, such as low total harmonic distortion (THD), fast dynamic response, reduced steady-state error, and reduced chattering.},

Direct processing of the analog input signal is used to obtain the corresponding crisp value; the digital portion is used only for programmability. No A/D and D/A converters are needed.

abstract = {The Synchronous Transfer Architecture is a low power architecture of VLIW processor, which enables the direct data routing through buffered output ports of functional units. To improve the system efficiency of STA, in this paper we propose a novel approach to integrate compiler techniques with architecture exploration: A fuzzy control system is implemented to help the compiler back-end determine the optimal configuration of the STA processor and the corresponding target VLIW for different applications. This approach achieves the integration of the optimizations of code generation and hardware design. According to our studies, the drop in execution time is between 18\% and 43\% compared to the compiled ARM assembly code. Up to 42.4\% register read and 67.9\% register write operations are cut down on average. Except for reding the input data and writing back the results, all the other memory accesses for ARM architecture are avoided, giving us a dramatic reduction in the power consumption. Finally, the novel approach enjoys short compilation time and less complex implementation. Â© 2011 IEEE.},

This includes controller design, parameters tuning, and implementation using a multiprocessor system. Results proved the effectiveness of the proposed techniques to improve performance and functionality. It is shown that customizing HW and software (SW) within MPSoCs provides higher RT performance. Moreover, using multicore MCUs can reduce design time, implementation time, and cost, while keeping adequate performance. Therefore, it is possible to realize and implement complex RT embedded controllers that employ advanced control algorithms in rapid, effective, and cost-efficient fashion.},

The onboard control system components of the satellite are subjected to high temperature, shock and vibration both during initial transport and launch, and also during periodical orbital corrections. These effects can introduce faults in the control systems mounted on the space vehicle. Providing redundant hardware is a common method of recovering from faults, but this method is not feasible since it increases both space and weight, which is totally undesirable in space vehicles. An alternative approach of fault recovery is to perform reconfiguration of existing circuitry. This work focuses on reconfigurable hardware based fault recovery for analog linear feedback control systems using Field Programmable Analog Arrays (FPAA). The fault recovery scheme is developed generic by considering the faulty system as a black box with no access to its interior for repair or replacement of failed components and is applicable for both closed loop and open loop systems.

The main microprocessor also simulates the TSK neuro-fuzzy classifier in testing mode to recognize the ECG beats. The design brings various theoretical solutions into practical applications. Design/methodology/approach - The ECG signals are acquired and pre-processed using the Field-Programmable Analog Array (FPAA) IC due to the ability of precise configuration of analog parameters. The R peak of the QRS complexes and a window of 300 ms of ECG signals around the R peak are detected. In this paper we have proposed a method to extract the signal features using the Hermite decomposition algorithm, which requires only a multiplication of two matrices. Based on the features vectors, the ECG beats are classified using a TSK neuro-fuzzy network, whose parameters are trained earlier on PC and downloaded into the device. The device performance was tested with the ECG signals from the MIT-BIH database to prove the correctness of the hardware implementations. Findings - The FPAA and Programmable System on Chip (PSoC) technologies allow us to integrate many signal processing blocks in a compact device. In this paper the device has the same performance in ECG signal processing and classifying as achieved on PC simulators. This confirms the correctness of the implementation. Research limitations/implications - The device was fully tested with the signals from the MIT-BIH databases. For new patients, we have tested the device in collecting the ECG signals and QRS detections. We have not created a new database of ECG signals, in which the beats are examined by doctors and annotated the type of the rhythm (normal or abnormal, which type of arrhythmia, etc.) so we have not tested the classification mode of the device on real ECG signals. Social implications - The compact design of an intelligent ECG classifier offers a portable solution for patients with heart diseases, which can help them to detect the arrhythmia on time when the doctors are not nearby. This type of device not only may help to improve the patients' safety but also contribute to the smart, inter-networked life style. Originality/value - The device integrate a number of solutions including software, hardware and algorithms into a single, compact device. Thank to the advance of programmable ICs such as FPAA and PSoC, the designed device can acquire one channel of ECG signals, extract the features and classify the arrhythmia type (if detected) using the neuro-fuzzy TSK network in online mode.},

abstract = {The most commonly used controller in the industry field is the proportional- plus-integral (PI) controller, which requires a mathematical model of the system. Fuzzy logic controller (FLC) provides an alternative to conventional PI controller, especially when the available system models are inexact or unavailable. Also, rapid advances in digital technologies have given designers the option of implementing controllers using field programmable gate array (FPGA) which depends on parallel programming. This method has many advantages over classical microprocessors. In this research work, a FLC, which is fabricated on modern FPGA card (Spartan-3A, Xilinx Company), is proposed to implement a prototype of a speed controller for three-phase induction motor (squirrel cage type). The FLC and the PWM inverter strategies which have been built in FPGA appeared fast speed response and good stability in controlling the three-phase induction motor. For comparison purpose, a conventional PI controller has been implemented in the same FPGA card to examine the performance of the FLC. These controllers have been tested using MATLAB/Simulink program under various reference speeds. The designed FPGA-based closed-loop FLCâs performance is weighed against with that of a conventional PI controller. The system has been simulated in MATLAB/ Simulink, and the results have been attached. The simulation and experimental results obtained using a FPGA-based conventional PI controller and the FPGAbased FLC have been compared in terms of settling time, and it has been found out that the proposed FPGA-based FLC shows a better performance than the conventional PI controller.},

abstract = {The field-programmable gate array (FPGA) based intelligent sun tracking system proposed in this paper uses an NI 9642 controller to integrate the dual-axis sun tracking system with a Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT), so as to effectively increase the output power of solar panels. Furthermore, it is provided with multiple intelligent functions, so that the system can start up the sun tracking function automatically in the daytime, and automatically return to its initial position at night. It has a delay function to reduce the electric power consumed by the motor in rotation. Moreover, it can be switched to dual-axis or one-axis sun tracking freely as required by the user, and the solar panel inclination can be operated directly. The dual-axis sun tracking system uses the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method to look for the parameters of the PI controller. The Taguchi Method and Logistic Map are proposed to enhance the steady state convergence of PSO in seeking the optimal solution. The MPPT uses Fuzzy Logic to adjust the step length of the incremental conductance method, so as to remedy the defects in the traditional fixed step method, and to make the solar panel output reach the maximum power point position rapidly and stably.},

abstract = {Converters for photovoltaic (PV) systems usually consist of two stages: a dc/dc booster and a pulsewidth modulated (PWM) inverter. This cascade of converters presents efficiency issues, interactions between its stages, and problems with the maximum power point tracking. Therefore, only part of the produced electrical energy is utilized. In this paper, the authors propose a single-phase H-bridge multilevel converter for PV systems governed by a new integrated fuzzy logic controller (FLC)/modulator. The novelties of the proposed system are the use of a fully FLC (not requiring any optimal PWM switching-angle generator and proportionalintegral controller) and the use of an H-bridge power-sharing algorithm. Most of the required signal processing is performed by a mixed-mode field-programmable gate array, resulting in a fully integrated System-on-Chip controller. The general architecture of the system and its main performance in a large spectrum of practical situations are presented and discussed. The proposed system offers improved performance over two-level inverters, particularly at lowmedium power. Â© 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {The automatic diagnosis of breast cancer (BC) is an important, real-world medical problem. This paper proposes a design of automated detection, segmentation, and classification of breast cancer nuclei using a fuzzy logic. The first step is based on segmentation using an active contour for cell tracking and isolating of the nucleus in the cytological image. Then from this nucleus, have been extracted some textural features using the wavelet transforms to characterize image using its texture, so that malign texture can be differentiated from benign one with the assumption that tumoral texture is different from the texture of other kinds of tissues. Finally, the obtained features will be introduced as the input vector of a fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering algorithm to classify the images into malign and benign ones. The implementation of such algorithm has been done using a methodology based on very high speed integrated circuit, hardware description language (VHDL).

To overcome the non-linearity between received signal strength (RSS) and distance, edge weights between each target node and neighboring anchor nodes have been considered to compute the location of the target node. These edge weights are modeled using fuzzy logic system (FLS) to reduce the computational complexity. The edge weights are further optimized by HPSO and BBO separately to minimize the location error.

abstract = {In this paper, fuzzy (inaccuracy, vague, dispersion of individual interpretation) and random (incompleteness, noise and variability) uncertainties of electric load forecasting are modeled by random fuzzy variables (RFVs). Further integrating it into neural networks (NN) to formulate a novel integrated technique-Random Fuzzy NN (RFNN) for load forecasting is presented. The features of this methodology are as follows. (1) It is able to effectively and simultaneously model referred uncertainties occurred in load forecasting by one integrated technique, which existing techniques (e.g. fuzzified NN or Bayesian NN) tackle them separately. (2) Specially, historical data/information containing incompleteness, inaccuracy and vagueness can be modeled by the proposed representations of RFVs. No preprocessing algorithms such as data imputation or discard are required. (3) The proposed RFNN can make NN incorporating both types of uncertainties of inputs and network parameters so as to possess with better tackling uncertainties of load forecasting than other relevant methods. The proposed techniques are applied to electric load forecasting using a real operational data collected from Macau electric utility. Its application is promising in microgrid/small power system or in forecasting curves of individual customer where load curves would present a much higher variability and more noise than global curves of power grid of one country/region.},

abstract = {The work in this paper presents techniques for design, development, and control of hybrid electric vehicles (HEV's). Toward these ends, four issues are explored. First, the development of HEV's is presented. This synopsis includes a novel definition of degree of hybridization for automotive vehicles. Second, a load-leveling vehicle operation strategy is developed. In order to accomplish the strategy, a fuzzy logic controller is proposed. Fuzzy logic control is chosen because of the need for a controller for a nonlinear, multidomain, and time-varying plant with multiple uncertainties. Third, a novel technique for system integration and component sizing is presented. Fourth, the system design and control strategy is both simulated and then implemented in an actual vehicle. The controller examined in this study increased the fuel economy of a conventional full-sized vehicle from 40 to 55.7 mi/h and increased the average efficiency over the Federal Urban Driving Schedule from 23\% to 35.4\%. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of intelligent control and mechatronic systems as they apply to automobiles.},

An auxiliary device is required by the driver to avoid an accident. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs) are systems designed to help the driver in the driving process. The Overtaking Assistance System (OAS) is a subsystem of an ADAS that functions by assisting the driver in the overtaking process. This paper presents a decision-making system based on fuzzy logic for the OAS. The inputs in a decision-making system are the distance of the ego vehicle and the vehicle that will be overtaken as well as the distance of the ego vehicle and the vehicle in the other lane. The decisions involved in a decision-making system concern the vehicle performing the approaching, tailgating, and overtaking. The results from hardware simulation using a remote control car show that the decision-making system algorithm can work according to the design.},

abstract = {In the last two decades, in the transportation sector, use of air conditioner in buses, cars, trains and aviation industry increased rapidly. Further, with the growth in agriculture sector towards food processing industry, including storage plants which need high capacity refrigeration plants for storage, preservation and transportation of end products, use of an air-conditioner or refrigeration is increased. As fuel consumption is the only available energy in transportation for mobile air conditioner, reduction of fuel consumption has direct positive effect in improving fuel consumption efficiency, reducing pollution and saving economy. So far as moving vehicles are concerned, the air conditioner (passenger based transportation) or refrigeration (preservation of different food items during transportation) units are in the form of pay-loads carried on vehicles. Thus, the primary objective is transportation, while luxury, comfort and preservation are the secondary considerations. In this context, the availability of embedded processor based electronic modules installed in air conditioner or refrigeration units is the technological need. In order to realize such embedded systems, the associated electronic hardware has to have built-in features for energy saving. The emphasis at the technical specification (including tender document requirement) for incorporating these energy saving modules does not appear specifically since most of the times, these units do not support the hardware features for energy saving. This paper brings out fuzzy logic based approaches for energy saving in the design and implementation of electronic hardware systems for air conditioner units.This paper proposes an off-the shelf method for making air conditioner units more energy efficient, which reduces fuel consumed by mobile air conditioner facility available in different transportation vehicles. Reduction in fuel consumption has direct impact on the environment which is very unique thing while addressing issues in the renewable and non-renewable energy sectors. The electronic hardware implementation is carried out using Xilinx ISE Design Suite 14.2 with Verilog-HDL.},

Four physical fuzzy variables of a turbo-charged automobile, i.e., throttle size, pressure ratio, engine displacement, and total effective pipe length between the throttle and turbo charger, are chosen as the input to our intelligent reasoning algorithm system to produce the mass air flow for correction. The mass air flow for correction can then be applied on the compressor map of turbo charger to determine the real surge boundary for a certain turbo-charged automobile. In comparison with the previous approach using quadratic interpolation formula for exact real surge boundary, our new approach can indeed produce nearly the same answer with simplified computation load.

abstract = {Bank failure prediction is an important issue for the regulators of the banking industries. The collapse and failure of a bank could trigger an adverse financial repercussion and generate negative impacts such as a massive bail out cost for the failing bank and loss of confidence from the investors and depositors. Very often, bank failures are due to financial distress. Hence, it is desirable to have an early warning system (EWS) that identifies potential bank failure or high-risk banks through the traits of financial distress. Various traditional statistical models have been employed to study bank failures [J Finance 1 (1975) 21; J Banking Finance 1 (1977) 249; J Banking Finance 10 (1986) 511; J Banking Finance 19 (1995) 1073]. However, these models do not have the capability to identify the characteristics of financial distress and thus function as black boxes. This paper proposes the use of a new neural fuzzy system [Foundations of neuro-fuzzy systems, 1997], namely the Generic Self-organising Fuzzy Neural Network (GenSoFNN) [IEEE Trans Neural Networks 13 (2002c) 1075] based on the compositional rule of inference (CRI) [Commun ACM 37 (1975) 77], as an alternative to predict banking failure. The CRI based GenSoFNN neural fuzzy network, henceforth denoted as GenSoFNN-CRI(S), functions as an EWS and is able to identify the inherent traits of financial distress based on financial covariates (features) derived from publicly available financial statements. The interaction between the selected features is captured in the form of highly intuitive IF-THEN fuzzy rules. Such easily comprehensible rules provide insights into the possible characteristics of financial distress and form the knowledge base for a highly desired EWS that aids bank regulation. The performance of the GenSoFNN-CRI(S) network is subsequently benchmarked against that of the Cox's proportional hazards model [J Banking Finance 10 (1986) 511; J Banking Finance 19 (1995) 1073], the multi-layered perceptron (MLP) and the modified cerebellar model articulation controller (MCMAC) [IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern: Part B 30 (2000) 491] in predicting bank failures based on a population of 3635 US banks observed over a 21 years period. Three sets of experiments are performed-bank failure classification based on the last available financial record and prediction using financial records one and two years prior to the last available financial statements. The performance of the GenSoFNN-CRI(S) network as a bank failure classification and EWS is encouraging.},

Resistance welding, a kind of fusion bonding, is a widespread alternative process to mechanical fastening and adhesive bonding in joining thermoplastic composites. A second-order linear observer was identified to estimate the online temperature at the weld interface. A fuzzy logic controller (FLC) was designed to control the weld temperature using both process voltage and linear weld speed as the control inputs and using the temperature estimate as the feedback signal. The FLC was implemented in real time with the experimental setup using an industrial robot - KUKA KR 210. The closed-loop controller was capable of successfully controlling the weld temperature within 10\% of the desired temperature, resulting in superior weld quality when compared to open-loop results. The results thus affirm the suitability of the control strategy for large-scale automated welding.},

abstract = {In this study the environmental impact of consolidated rice farms (CF) - farms which have been integrated to increase the mechanization index - and traditional farms (TF) - small farms with lower mechanization index - in Guilan Province, Iran, were evaluated and compared using Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Foreground data were collected from farmers using face-to-face questionnaires and background information about production process and inventory data was taken from the EcoInventÂ®2.0 database. The system boundary was confined to within the farm gate (cradle to farm gate) and two functional units (land and mass based) were chosen. The study also included a comparison of the input-output energy flows of the farms. The results revealed that the average amount of energy consumed by the CFs was 57 GJ compared to 74.2 GJ for the TFs. The energy ratios for CFs and TFs were 1.6 and 0.9, respectively. The LCA results indicated that CFs produced fewer environmental burdens per ton of produced rice. When compared according to the land-based FU the same results were obtained. This indicates that the differences between the two types of farms were not caused by a difference in their production level, but rather by improved management on the CFs. The analysis also showed that electricity accounted for the greatest share of the impact for both types of farms, followed by P-based and N-based chemical fertilizers. These findings suggest that the CFs had superior overall environmental performance compared to the TFs in the study area. The performance metrics of the model based on ANFIS show that it can be used to predict the environmental burdens of rice production with high accuracy and minimal error.},

abstract = {The depletion of fossil fuel and the environmental impact of using fossil fuel as a main energy source have been subjects of intense research and policy interest in recent years. Pyrolysis of biomass to produce bio-energy is a promising process. However, with the resulting high cost, creating a cost effective chemical plant is very important. A comprehensive process model, which can be used to predict the production from pyrolysis of biomass, is therefore necessary. However, modeling is complex and challenging because of short reaction times, temperatures as high as a thousand degrees Celsius, and biomass of varying or unknown chemical compositions. As such a deterministic model is not capable of representing the pyrolysis reaction system. We propose a new kinetic reaction model, which would account for significant uncertainty. Specifically we have employed fuzzy modeling using the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) in order to describe the pyrolysis of biomass. The resulting model is in better agreement with experimental data than known deterministic models. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Based on it, the theory of fuzzy logic is introduced to construct the corresponding membership function when the extracted wavelet coefficients are considered as linguistic variables respectively. The firing strength values of each corresponding fuzzy region are calculated in the fuzzy feature space, which then constitute the banknote feature vector after being normalized. The banknote recognition can be conducted by the neural network classifier.

In this paper, the FLC is used as a speed controller and the motor is fed from a four-switch three-phase (4S3Ph) pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) inverter instead of a conventional six-switch three-phase (6S3Ph) inverter. This reduces the cost of the inverter, the switching losses, and the complexity of the control algorithms and interface circuits to generate six PWM logic signals. Furthermore, the proposed control approach reduces the computation for real-time implementation. The closed-loop vector control scheme of the proposed 4S3Ph-inverter-fed IPMSM drive incorporating the FLC is implemented in real time using the digital signal processor (DSP) TI TMS320C31 for a prototype 1-hp motor.

It involves the application of a proper sequence of voltage pulses to the stator windings, and the measurement of the peak values of the resulting current in order to achieve the rotor position estimation. Actually, the current measurements show significant uncertainties which affect the rotor position detection. In order to avoid these problems, the authors propose a novel procedure which combines an iterative sequence of voltage pulses with a fuzzy logic processing of the current responses and phase current derivation based on the dc-link current measurements. The proposed method has been implemented on a $\mu$C digital signal processor (TMS320F240). The obtained results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

The paper describes a fuzzy logic based on-line efficiency optimization control of a drive that uses an indirect vector controlled induction motor speed control system in the inner loop. At steady-state light-load condition, a fuzzy controller adaptively decrements the excitation current on the basis of measured input power such that, for a given load torque and speed, the drive settles down to the minimum input power, i.e., operates at maximum efficiency. The low-frequency pulsating torque due to decrementation of rotor flux is compensated in a feedforward manner. If the load torque or speed command changes, the efficiency search algorithm is abandoned and the rated flux is established to get the best transient response. The drive system with the proposed efficiency optimization controller has been simulated with lossy models of converter and machine, and its performance has been thoroughly investigated. An experimental drive system with the proposed controller implemented on a TMS320C25 digital signal processor, has been tested in laboratory to validate the theoretical development.},

DTC also allows a good torque control in steady state and transient operating conditions. In this paper, development of DTC is discussed. The DTC based on space vector modulation (SVM) and switching table has been reviewed. With successively improving reliability and performance of digital technologies, digital control techniques have predominated over analog techniques. Digital control techniques are carried out with microcontrollers, digital signal processors due to their software flexibility and low cost which are being reviewed.

abstract = {This paper presents a novel fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) in electric vehicles (EV). As an IPMSM used for electric vehicles, d- and q-axis inductances are varied in wide range. Thus, based on inductances variation, the inductances are analysed as a function of both current magnitude and phase. Then, a novel fuzzy logic control algorithm is proposed that that uses the parameters variation of the inductances is proposed. The algorithm adjusts the reference current of the drive system according to the speed and torque statues. A digital signal processor (DSP) chip TMS28335 is used to implement a complete drive system for a 50kW IPMSM prototype motor. Experimental results have been carried out in order to prove the effectiveness of the new FLC.},

@article{Rafa2014,
abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present a new approach to control an induction motor using type-1 fuzzy logic. The induction motor has a nonlinear model, uncertain and strongly coupled. The vector control technique, which is based on the inverse model of the induction motors, solves the coupling problem. Unfortunately, in practice this is not checked because of model uncertainties. Indeed, the presence of the uncertainties led us to use human expertise such as the fuzzy logic techniques. In order to maintain the decoupling and to overcome the problem of the sensitivity to the parametric variations, the field-oriented control is replaced by a new block control. The simulation results show that the both control schemes provide in their basic configuration, comparable performances regarding the decoupling. However, the fuzzy vector control provides the insensitivity to the parametric variations compared to the classical one. The fuzzy vector control scheme is successfully implemented in real-time using a digital signal processor board dSPACE 1104. The efficiency of this technique is verified as well as experimentally at different dynamic operating conditions such as sudden loads change, parameter variations, speed changes, etc. The fuzzy vector control is found to be a best control for application in an induction motor.},

abstract = {A novel simplified self-tuned neuro-fuzzy controller (NFC) for speed control of an induction motor (IM) drive is presented in this paper. The proposed NFC combines fuzzy logic and a four-layer neural network structure. Only speed error is employed as input to the NFC so that the computational burden of the NFC is reduced and it becomes suitable for real-time industrial drive applications. Based on the knowledge of back-propagation algorithm, an unsupervised self-tuning method is developed to adjust membership functions and weights of the proposed NFC so that the performance will be similar to that of the conventional two-input NFC. The complete drive incorporating the proposed self-tuned NFC is experimentally implemented using a digitalsignal-processor board DS-1104 for a laboratory 1/3-hp motor. The effectiveness of the proposed NFC-based vector control of IM drive is tested in both simulation and experiment at different operating conditions. Comparative results show that the simplification of the proposed NFC does not decrease the system performance as compared to the conventional NFC. In order to prove the superiority of the proposed simplified NFC, the performances of the proposed NFC are also compared to those obtained by a conventional proportional-integral controller.

abstract = {Dynamic behavior of the harmonic detection part of an active power filter (APF) has an essential role in filter compensation performances during transient conditions. Instantaneous power (pâq) theory is extensively used to design harmonic detectors for active filters. Large overshoot of pâq theory method deteriorates filter response at a large and rapid load change. In this study the harmonic estimation of an APF during transient conditions for balanced three-phase nonlinear loads is conducted. A novel fuzzy instantaneous power (FIP) theory is proposed to improve conventional pâq theory dynamic performances during transient conditions to adapt automatically to any random and rapid nonlinear load change. Adding fuzzy rules in pâq theory improves the decomposition of the alternating current components of active and reactive power signals and develops correct reference during rapid and random current variation. Modifying pâq theory internal high-pass filter performance using fuzzy rules without any drawback is a prospect. In the simulated system using MATLAB/SIMULINK, the shunt active filter is connected to a rapidly time-varying nonlinear load. The harmonic detection parts of the shunt active filter are developed for FIP theory-based and pâq theory-based algorithms. The harmonic detector hardware is also developed using the TMS320F28335 digital signal processor and connected to a laboratory nonlinear load. The software is developed for FIP theory-based and pâq theory-based algorithms. The simulation and experimental tests results verify the ability of the new technique in harmonic detection of rapid changing nonlinear loads.},

abstract = {Brushless motors are used in many applications owing to their advantages. In most of the applications, conventional control methods with a hysteresis band (HB) controller are used. An improved speed and current control scheme for brushless DC motors with a trapezoidal shape back EMF is presented. Instead of the conventional HB and proportional-integral (PI) controllers, a fuzzy logic controller that is independent of motor equations and based on expert knowledge has been employed for current and also for speed regulation; thereby, the disadvantages of the HB are eliminated and the overall performance of the controller is enhanced. Experimental studies have been carried out with a TMS320F2812 digital signal processor. The presented control scheme has been validated through comparative experiments with the fuzzy logic speed and HB current controller. The results show that the proposed control scheme operates satisfactorily and provides a constant switching frequency. Â© The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.},

abstract = {This paper presents a fuzzy logic controller (FLC)-based single-ended primary-inductor converter (SEPIC) for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) operation of a photovoltaic (PV) system. The FLC proposed presents that the convergent distribution of the membership function offers faster response than the symmetrically distributed membership functions. The fuzzy controller for the SEPIC MPPT scheme shows high precision in current transition and keeps the voltage without any changes, in the variable-load case, represented in small steady-state error and small overshoot. The proposed scheme ensures optimal use of PV array and proves its efficacy in variable load conditions, unity, and lagging power factor at the inverter output (load) side. The real-time implementation of the MPPT SEPIC converter is done by a digital signal processor (DSP), i.e., TMS320F28335. The performance of the converter is tested in both simulation and experiment at different operating conditions. The performance of the proposed FLC-based MPPT operation of SEPIC converter is compared to that of the conventional proportional-integral (PI)-based SEPIC converter. The results show that the proposed FLC-based MPPT scheme for SEPIC can accurately track the reference signal and transfer power around 4.8\% more than the conventional PI-based system.

abstract = {A wavelet fuzzy neural network using asymmetric membership function (WFNN-AMF) with improved differential evolution (IDE) algorithm is proposed in this study to control a six-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) for an electric power steering (EPS) system. First, the dynamics of a steer-by-wire EPS system and a six-phase PMSM drive system are described in detail. Moreover, the WFNN-AMF controller, which combines the advantages of wavelet decomposition, fuzzy logic system, and asymmetric membership function (AMF), is developed to achieve the required control performance of the EPS system for the improvement of stability of the vehicle and the comfort of the driver. Furthermore, the online learning algorithm of WFNN-AMF is derived using back-propagation method. However, degenerated or diverged responses will be resulted due to the inappropriate selection of small or large learning rates of the WFNN-AMF. Therefore, an IDE algorithm is proposed to online adapt the learning rates of WFNN-AMF. In addition, a 32-bit floating-point digital signal processor, TMS320F28335, is adopted for the implementation of the proposed intelligent controlled EPS system. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed WFNN-AMF controller with IDE for the EPS system is verified through experimental results.},

For the multiplication, a multiplexer-based modified Wallace tree multiplier has been designed, and for the division and addition multiplexer-based non-restoring parallel divider and multiplexer-based Manchester adder have been used, respectively. To further increase the processing speed, fine-grain pipelining technique has been employed. By using this technique, the critical path of the circuit is broken into finer pieces. Based on the proposed architecture, and by using Quartus II 9.1, a sample two-input, one-output digital fuzzy logic controller with eight rules has been successfully synthesised and implemented on Stratix II field programmable gate array.

abstract = {Due to the complex structure of IT2 FLCs, using them in real-time applications might be computationally expensive. To facilitate real-time implementation of these controllers, hardware with parallel processing abilities are recommended; field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) are one class of such hardware. In this paper, we design and implement three different inference mechanisms of IT2 FLCs on hardware. These engines include Karnik-Mendel (KM) algorithms, Wu-Mendel (WM) uncertainty bounds, Nie-Tan (NT) and Biglarbegian-Melek-Mendel (BMM) which have recently been introduced in the literature. We first demonstrate how the proposed structures of the IT2 FLCs can be implemented on software; next, we propose architectures for implementing these IT2 FLCs on hardware. We performed simulations to compare the performance of the IT2 FLCs. To assess the controllers performance in real-time we used four indicators; the number of DSP48A1s, MUXCYs, slice registers and slice LUTs. It was shown that the NT and BMM controllers require significantly fewer resources compared to the other engines. While the controller that uses KM as its inference engine uses fewer resources in terms of DSP48A1s, it consumes a considerable amount of other resources compared to the WM controller. Finally, the transient responses of the controllers in terms of rise time and settling time were compared. It was found that the controllers with NT and BMM inference engines have faster closed-loop response in comparison to the one using the WM and KM. The results presented herein provides researchers and engineers a better insight into designing the most suitable IT2 FLCs, and hence it is expected IT2 FLCs can be implemented on hardware to further enable applications on plants requiring fast response (or ultimately real-time implementation).},

abstract = {In this paper, a novel fuzzy logic controller called linguistic-hedge fuzzy logic controller in a mixed-signal circuit design is discussed. The linguistic-hedge fuzzy logic controller has the following advantages: 1) it needs only three simple-shape membership functions for characterizing each variable prior to the linguistic-hedge modifications; 2) it is sufficient to adopt nine rules for inference; 3) the rules are developed intuitively without heavy dependence on the endeavors of experts; 4) it performs better than conventional fuzzy logic controllers; and 5) it can be realized with a lower design complexity and a smaller hardware overhead as compared with the controllers that required more than nine rules. In this implementation, a current-mode approach is adopted in designing the signal processing portions to simplify the circuit complexity; digital circuits are adopted to implement the programmable units. This design was fabricated with a TSMC 0.35 $\mu$m single-polysilicon-quadruple-metal CMOS process. In this chip, the LHFLC processes two input variables and one output variable. Each variable is specified using three membership functions. Nine inference rules, scheduled in a rule table with a dimension of 3 Ã 3, define the relationship implications between these three variables. Under a supply voltage of 3.3 V, the measurement results show that the measured control surface and the control goal are consistent. The speed of inference operation goes up to 0.5M FLIPS that is fast enough for the control application of the cart-pole balance system. The cart-pole balance system experimental results show that this chip works with nine inference rules.

abstract = {In this paper, design and simulation of a current-mode CMOS Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) is presented. The proposed controller is composed of Membership Function Circuit (MFC), fuzzy inference engine with min-product method and current-mode defuzzification circuit. MFC has a new architecture that generates basic four membership functions (trapezoidal, triangle, Z-shape and S-shape). These membership functions are simply tuneable by adjusted two voltages via setting some analogue switches in a shape/label select circuit block which is called programming unit. Also, a novelty designed current-mode defuzzification circuit is based on current-mode four-quadrant multipliers that have been constructed simple current squarer and substractor circuits. The proposed current-mode CMOS FLC has been simulated and verified for two inputs, one output and nine tuneable fuzzy rules by using PSPICE program with MIETEC 1.2 $\mu$m design parameters. The proposed architecture has an operation speed of 6.25 MFLIPS (6.25 Ã 106 Fuzzy Logic Inference per Second). Copyright Â© 2008, Inderscience Publishers.},

abstract = {This paper describes the design of a high speed min/max architecture based on a new current comparator. The main advantage of the proposed circuit which employs a novel preamplifier-latch comparator is the higher operating frequency feature in comparison with previous works. Because the comparator can work in voltage mode, the min/max structure can be redesigned either in voltage or current mode. The designed comparator is refreshed without any external clock. Therefore, it does not degrade the speed performance of proposed min/max structure. These features along with low power consumption qualify the proposed architecture to be widely used in high speed fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs). Post-layout simulation results confirm 3.4 GS/s comparison rate with 9-bit resolution for a 0.9 V peak-to-peak input signal range for the comparator and 800 MHz operating frequency for min/max circuit.

abstract = {The fundamental issue in gain scheduling along a desired reference trajectory is the question of guaranteed stability of the overall gain-scheduled closed-loop system. Since the gain-scheduled design is based on linear-time-invariant approximation of the open-loop system, and since this system is actually nonlinear, the design guarantees only local stability. This requires a further restriction, namely that the desired reference trajectory should vary slowly. The design of a fuzzy gain scheduler requires a conventional model of the nonlinear system under control and a partition of the state space into a finite number of fuzzy regions. The nonlinear system is Lyapunov-linearized at the center of each fuzzy region. Then linear controllers intended to locally stabilize the linearized system, and consequently the original nonlinear system, at the center of a fuzzy region are designed. In that way, gain-scheduling control of the original nonlinear system can be designed to cope with any (unknown in advance) slowly time-varying desired trajectory. This paper shows how the stability and robustness analysis of the gain-scheduled closed-loop system in terms of sliding-mode control techniques can be used for the design of a supervisory system which avoids unstable behavior outside the region in which local stability is guaranteed.},

This paper aims to analyze and design the control of power generation operation system in small disturbance events. This condition is affected by changes in the prime mover of mechanical power input in generator system due to power fluctuation in load, so that the system becomes unstable. In the analysis of electrical power distribution, generation unit provides power output based on regulations of fluctuating power. This distribution system that provides continuous data periodically is actually performing a pattern of dynamic time series model. Within the statistical methods analysis, the presentation of load data will be analyzed through clustering method based on the average distribution and peak loads. This kind of pattern description is purposed to enable the control system for anticipating the changes in the load model, where each of load cluster represents one dynamic system model in appropriate operation condition. The solution of dynamic models control systems, performed by Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Inference System (TS-FIS) as multiple soft switching controllers and optimal control gain for each dynamic model. Those can be distributed into TS-FIS outputs, to achieve robustness of power generation system that affected by changes in huge variation of load power. In this study, the cluster analysis technique has produced seven data's groups with interval of 18 MVA. By performing Robust-Fuzzy control through TS-FIS as multiple soft switching, can be proved that the power generating performance is better than using Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) optimal control, since Robust-Fuzzy control Integral Absolute Error (IAE) is better than LQR optimal control IAE.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new adaptive fuzzy control scheme called model reference adaptive fuzzy control (MRAFC). The MRAFC scheme employs a reference model to provide closed-loop performance feedback for generating or modifying a fuzzy controller's knowledge base. The MRAFC scheme grew from ideas in conventional model reference adaptive control (MRAC). The MARFC scheme is developed to perform adaptive feedback linearization to a class of nonlinear systems. A class of fuzzy controllers, which can be expressed in an explicit form, is used as the primary controller. Based on Lyapunov's second method, we have developed MARFC schemes and derived fuzzy rule adaptive laws. Hence, not only the stability of the system can be assured but also the performance, such as the issues of robustness and parameter convergence, of the MRAFC system can he analyzed explicitly. We showed that in the case of no modeling error, the state error converges to zero asymptotically. In the case that persistent excitation is satisfied, we showed that the MRAFC system is asymptotically stable. By considering the periodic signal as reference input signal, we showed that the square wave can make the MRAFC system be persistently excited. The feasibility of applying these techniques has been demonstrated by considering the control of an inverted pendulum in following a reference model response.},

abstract = {Min-max model predictive control (MPC) is one of the few techniques suitable for robust stabilization of uncertain nonlinear systems subject to constraints. Stability issues as well as robustness have been recently studied and some novel contributions on this topic have appeared in the literature. In this survey, we distill from an extensive literature a general framework for synthesizing min-max MPC schemes with ana priori robust stability guarantee. First, we introduce a general predictionmodel that covers a wide class of uncertainties, which includes bounded disturbances as well as state and input dependent disturbances (uncertainties). Second, we extend the notion of regional input-to-state stability (ISS) in order to fit the considered class of uncertainties. Then, we establish that the standard min-max approach can only guarantee practical stability. We concentrate our attention on two different solutions for solving this problem. The first one is based on a particular design of the stage cost of the performance index, which leads to aH1 strategy, while the second one is based on a dual-mode strategy. Under fairly mild assumptions both controllers guarantee ISS of the resulting closed-loop system.Moreover, it is shown that the nonlinear auxiliary control law introduced in [29] to solve theH1 problem can be used, for nonlinear systems affine in control, in all the proposed min-max schemes and also in presence of state-independent disturbances. A simulation example illustrates the techniques surveyed in this article. Â© 2009 EUCA.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a robust observer-based output feedback control for fuzzy descriptor systems. First, we represent singular nonlinear dynamic system into Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy descriptor model which have a tighter representation for a wider class of nonlinear systems in comparison to general state-space models. To achieve the control objective, we design a fuzzy controller and observer in a unified and systematic manner. The stability analysis of the overall closed-loop fuzzy system leads to formulation of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The advantages of the approach are three fold. First, we consider conditions of immeasurable states which allows a practical design of sensorless control systems. Secondly, we address the robustness issue in the system which avoids control performance deterioration or instability due to disturbance or approximation errors in the system. Third, we formulate the overall control problem into LMIs. Using the observer and controller gains by solving LMIs, we carry out numerical simulations which verify theoretical statements.

@article{Zadeh1993,
abstract = {The past few years have witnessed a rapid growth of interest in a cluster of modes of modeling and computation which may be described collectively as softcomputing. The distinguishing characteristic of a soft computing is that its primary aim is to achieve tractability, robustness, low cost and high MIQ (machine intelligence quodent) through an exploitation of the tolerance for imprecision and uncertainty. Thus, in soft computing what is usually sought in an approximate solution to a precisely formulated problem or more typically, an approximate solution to an imprecisely formulated problem. A simple case in point is the problem of parking a car. Generally, humans can park a car rather easily because the final position of the car is not specified exactly. If it were specified to within, say, a few millimeters and a fraction of a degree, it would take hours or days of maneuvering and precise measurements of distance and angular position to solve the problem. What this simple example points to is the fact that, in general, high precision carries a high cost. The challenge, then, is to exploit the tolerance for imprecision by devising methods of computation which lead to an acceptable solution at low cost. By its nature, soft computing is much closer to human reasoning than the traditional modes of computation. At this juncture, the major components of soft computing are fuzzy logic (FL), neural network theory (NN) and probabilistic reasoning techniques (PR), including genetic algorithms, chaos theory and parts of learning theory. Increasingly, these techniques are used in combination to achieve significant improvement in performance and adaptability. Among the important application, areas for soft computing are control systems, expert systems, data compression techniques, image processing and decision support systems. It may be argued that it is soft computing -rather than the traditional hard computing- that should be viewed as the foundation for artificial intelligence. In the years ahead, this may well become a widely held position.},

@article{bhatt1989aditya,
abstract = {One of the methods of confining hot fusion plasmas is by use of the toroidal magnetic bottle known as tokamak. Aditya is the first tokamak, designed, fabricated, erected and commissioned by India. It is a moderate field (toroidal field 15 kGauss), medium size (minor radius 25 cm, major radius 75 cm) tokamak which should produce a 250 kA discharge with a peak density 3x1013 cm-3 and a peak electron temperature of about 5 million degrees. The plasma is generated in a stainless steel vessel evacuated to a base pressure of 10-9 torr. The vessel is surrounded by twenty large rectangular torroidal magnetic field coils. An ohmic transformer is placed in the central hole of the torus and is used to induce substantial voltage in the hydrogen gas (typically kept at 10-4 torr in the vessel) to cause its breakdown and drive and sustain plasma currents upto 250 kA. Other field coils produce programmed fields necessary for keeping the plasmas in equilibrium. Power is supplied to the various magnetic field coils in the form of dc pulses generated by transformer-converter systems controlled by a PDP 11/23 computer. The main source of the power is a 132 kV line connected to the Gujarat Electricity Board power grid system. Plasma parameters are to be measured by a variety of passive and active diagnostics. The data acquisition and control of the entire experiment is carried out using control system based on CAMAC and VAX 11/730 computer. Expesed on CAMAC and VAX 11/730 computer. Experiments dealing with plasma disruptions and their feedback control, plasmas with significant current in energetic carriers, etc. are the major directions of the experimental programme.

abstract = {The paper summarizes the basic information on the equilibrium of a toroidal plasma column in systems of the Tokamak type. It considers the methods of maintaining a plasma in equilibrium with the help of a conducting casing, an external maintaining field and the iron core of a transformer. Attention is paid to the role of the inhomogeneity of the maintaining field. It is shown in particular how the shape of the column cross-section depends on the curvature of the lines of force of the maintaining field. For the case (which has practical importance) weak asymmetry of the field distribution in the transverse cross-section, this paper describes a uniform method of consideration, which takes into account the influence of different factors on the equilibrium position of the column. This method is used for calculating plasma equilibrium in a Tokamak model with a conducting casing. Account is here taken of the effect of gaps in the casing and of finite electrical conductivity. Some cases of plasma equilibrium which are outside the standard Tokamak scheme are also considered, such as equilibrium in a conducting shell having the shape of a racetrack, equilibrium where the whole current is transferred by relativistic runaway electrons and equilibrium at high plasma pressure $\beta$ I \~{}R/a.},

abstract = {First-principles predictive models based on flux-averaged transport equations often yield complex expressions not suitable for real-time control implementations. It is however always possible to reduce these models to forms suitable for control design while preserving the dominant physics of the system. If further model simplification is desired at the expense of less model accuracy and controller capability, data-driven modeling emerges as an alternative to first-principles modeling. System identification techniques have the potential of producing low-complexity, linear models that can capture the system dynamics around an equilibrium point. This paper focuses on the control of the poloidal magnetic flux profile evolution in response to the heating and current drive (H\&CD) systems and the total plasma current. Open-loop data for model identification is collected during the plasma current flattop in a high-confinement scenario (H-mode). Using this data a linear state-space plasma response model for the poloidal magnetic flux profile dynamics around a reference profile is identified. The control goal is to use the H\&CD systems and the plasma current to regulate the magnetic profile around a desired target profile in the presence of disturbances. The target profile is defined close enough to the reference profile used for system identification in order to stay within the range of validity of the identified model. An optimal state feedback controller with integral action is designed for this purpose. Experimental results showing the performance of the proposed controller implemented in the DIII-D tokamak are presented. Â© 2012 AACC American Automatic Control Council).},

The quality of the discharge in the Saskatchewan TORus-Modified (STOR-M) tokamak is strongly related to the position of the plasma column within the discharge vessel. If the plasma column approaches too near the wall, then either minor or complete disruption occurs. Consequently it is necessary to be able to control dynamically the position of the plasma column throughout the entire discharge. A fuzzy-logic-based controller was designed and implemented for this purpose. This controller was evaluated on the STOR-M tokamak during actual operation, and was found to provide reliably a high quality of control. The actual performance of the fuzzy-logic-based controller at actually controlling the position of the plasma column within the STOR-M tokamak is evaluated against the actual performance of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller.

abstract = {In practically all fields of science, measurements are affected by noise, which can sometimes be modeled with an appropriate probability distribution function. The results of measurements are therefore known only with uncertainties that sometimes can be significant. In many cases the noise source is independent of the system to be studied and the quantities to be measured. In this paper, a numerical approach to handle statistical uncertainties, due to an independent noise source, in a fuzzy logic system is developed. Numerical analysis and various tests with a benchmark show how statistical error bars can be interpreted as an independent "axis of complexity" with respect to the fuzzy boundaries of the membership functions. The uncertainties in the inputs can be transferred to the output and handled separately from the system intrinsic fuzzyness. The main advantages of this independent treatment of the measurement errors are shown in the case of a binary classification task: the regime confinement identification in high-temperature tokamak plasmas. Significant improvements in the correct prediction rate have been achieved with respect to the classification performed without considering the error bars in the measurements.},

The pointing stability of the laser beam crossing the plasma could impact the measuring accuracy greatly. The laser beam path of the current TS diagnostic system on Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak is about 40 m, equipped with seven mirrors and one focusing lens. The laser beam needs to be aligned regularly because of the instability of laser beam pointing caused by many factors. In this paper, an automatic beam alignment system used to calibrate the deviations of laser beam is introduced. This system employs two Charge Coupled Device (CCD) cameras and two two-dimension adjustable servo-motorized mirror mounts. CCD cameras capture images of the laser spots to calculate their positions by processing the images. Then compare the calculated centroids with the reference values to find the deviations. A fuzzy logic controller is designed with the deviations in pixels accepted as the inputs, and its outputs are the data required to adjust the mirror mounts automatically. This system has been tried and it is corroborated that the deviations could be corrected in several minutes by adjusting the two servo-motorized mirror mounts automatically in turn.},

To fulfill the tasks in ITER application, this paper presents a hybrid redundant manipulator with four DOFs provided by serial kinematic axes and six DOFs by parallel mechanism. Thus, in machining, to achieve greater end-effector trajectory tracking accuracy for surface quality, a robust control of the actuators for the flexible link has to be deduced. In this paper, the intelligent control of a hydraulically driven parallel robot part based on the dynamic model and two control schemes have been investigated: (1) fuzzy-PID self tuning controller composed of the conventional PID control and with fuzzy logic; (2) adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system-PID (ANFIS-PID) self tuning of the gains of the PID controller, which are implemented independently to control each hydraulic cylinder of the parallel robot based on rod position predictions. The obtained results of the fuzzy-PID and ANFIS-PID self tuning controller can reduce more tracking errors than the conventional PID controller. Subsequently, the serial component of the hybrid robot can be analyzed using the equilibrium of reaction forces at the universal joint connections of the hexa-element. To achieve precise positional control of the end effector for maximum precision machining, the hydraulic cylinder should be controlled to hold the hexa-element. Finally, simulated results that demonstrate the robot behaviors are presented. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Qualitative information about the structure of a mapping can surely be of help in learning a mapping by a collection of input-output pairs. However, there are conditions in which time and some other constraints make guessing the only plausible means for interpreting data. In this paper, the problem of the plasma boundary reconstruction in "Tokamak" nuclear fusion rectors is assessed. The problem is formulated as an inverse "identification" problem and the mapping is derived by a properly generated database of simulated experiments. Real data coming from experiments are also available to validate both numerically generated data and extracted model. The identification problem is solved for two different databases by using neural networks and more conventional models. The introduction of techniques derived from soft computing is shown to improve the performance in various respects. Dynamic identification systems appear to be rather demanding also for such systems, for the need of rapidly interpreting real time data for discharge control. Soft computing approaches may yet yield some low cost ways to take decisions during plasma evolution. The approximate analysis of experimental data could also improve the knowledge on the particular problem allowing an evolution of the knowledge base. Experimental data related to ASDEX-Upgrade machine are presented in this work and preliminary processed. Soft computing techniques also allow to simply get ideas about two other interesting problems in plasma engineering, namely, the fault tolerance and the minimization of the number of sensors.

Specific algorithms have been developed to obtain these quantities and, with the aim of comparing the relative performances, li and RMAG have also been determined with suitable neural networks. Both procedures rely on the Shafranov integrals, which have been computed on the plasma last closed flux surface using an updated version of the fast boundary code XLOC. The two approaches have been verified on several classes of equilibrium and both in the limiter and x-point phases of the discharges. Their results have been measured against the estimates of the off-line JET equilibrium code EFIT and it has been found that they provide quite good evaluations of the required quantities, since the differences between their estimates and the EFIT ones are of the order of a few per cent. They also provide similar performances in terms of accuracy and computational speed and are quite robust in the case of poor quality signals. Both methods are consequently suitable for reliable real-time control systems in JET.},

abstract = {Simple physical models are often difficult to obtain for nonhomogeneous transport phenomena that involve complex couplings between several distributed variables, such as temperature profiles in tokamak plasmas. Model-based current or combustion control approaches necessitate plasma models with real-time computation capabilities. This may prevent the use of classical knowledge-based physical models and motivates dedicated identification methods to exploit the large available experimental data. Based on distributed temperature measurements, this paper proposes a parameter-dependent identification method that first relates the normalized profiles distribution to a specific shape description thanks to a three-hidden-layers neural network architecture. The amplitude of the profiles is then constrained by the global energy conservation (0D) with an identified time constant. The shape parameters and time constant are related to the global parameters using appropriate scaling laws. Experimental results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed identification method to estimate TORE SUPRA temperature profiles. Â© 2011 IEEE.},

In fuzzy systems, the defuzzifier stage is the most hardware resource consumer operation and has had many different approaches with the objective of reducing the resources consumed and increasing the processing speed. From these approaches and in order to improve the defuzzifier performance, the use of integer values and the avoidance of complex operations such as multiplication and division can be noted. This paper presents a novel defuzzifier method that is designed to work with $\alpha$-level based membership functions, using integer universes and avoiding multiplication operation.

Since all the continuous defuzzification mappings considered in this paper form a Banach space, approximation to the optimal mapping with some known functions can be expressed as the parametric optimization problem. To find the optimal parameters, adaptive learning of the optimal defuzzification mapping is investigated. Learning laws for the parameters in the defuzzification mapping are derived in one case.

Finally, in order to convert the fuzzy output in a usable form, we need to select a defuzzification strategy. This selection can be realized by testing one by one the defuzzification methods available in the literature, and taking the best one in terms of output error. However, this approach is not theoretically convincing. This selection can also be realized by considering the following logical criterion: fuzzification and defuzzification are, by nature, two complementary processes. In other words, the choice of a defuzzification strategy must be made with respect to the output fuzzification. In this paper, we present a defuzzification method which takes into account the parameters of the fuzzification in order to respect it.},

abstract = {Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy systems have successfully been employed, mainly in a trial-and-error manner, to solve many control and modeling problems; but their applications as signal filters remain to be fully explored. Compared to their nonfuzzy counterparts, TS fuzzy controllers and models are difficult to be efficiently constructed because there is a large number of design parameters in the rule consequent. The number grows dramatically with the increase of the number of input fuzzy sets and input variables. Furthermore, there exists little published result on relationship between TS fuzzy controllers/models/filters and their nonfuzzy counterparts. In this paper, we investigate, in relation to some popular nonfuzzy controllers, models and filters, analytical structure of a general class of multi-input single-output (MISO) TS fuzzy systems that use arbitrary fuzzy rules with our recently introduced simplified linear rule consequent. Other components of the fuzzy systems in this study are general: arbitrary continuous input fuzzy sets, any type of fuzzy logic AND and the generalized defuzzifier containing the widely used centroid defuzzifier as a special case. We prove that the general MISO TS fuzzy systems are: (1) nonlinear variable gain controllers when implemented as controllers, or (2) nonlinear time-varying auto-regressive with the extra input (ARX) models when implemented as models, or (3) nonlinear infinite impulse response (IIR) or finite impulse response (FIR) filters when implemented as filters. Furthermore, we constructively prove that the general TS fuzzy systems with the simplified linear rule consequent are universal approximators and can approximate any continuous function in closed domain arbitrarily well. The practical implication of these results is that these fuzzy systems, with much less design parameters, are always able to produce solutions to various control, modeling and filtering problems. We also establish sufficient conditions that can be used to calculate the number of input fuzzy sets and rules needed for achieving prespecified approximation accuracy.},

The use of IP modules together with powerful CAD tools, which facilitate the development of controllers, has major economic advantages, because it reduces the time involved in the development cycle of new products and accelerates their introduction in the market. In parallel, programmable logic devices have undergone considerable transformation in recent years. This has not only consisted of the increase in the number of general-purpose resources, but also of the introduction of specific elements (memory blocks, multipliers, clock signal generators, etc.), which allow very complex systems to be implemented on a FPGA. This has been reinforced by the existence of numerous system blocks available as IP modules or soft-cores (processors, I/O peripherals, memory controllers, etc) which facilitate the development of embedded processing systems adapted to a particular purpose. Examples include the MicroBlaze system from Xilinx and the Nios system from Altera. This paper describes the design of fuzzy logic-based controllers as IP modules compatible with the processing systems available in the current families from Xilinx. These modules can be used as standard peripherals connectable to the OPB bus for the processors available in FPGAs, such as MicroBlaze or Power PC. The use of inference techniques based on fuzzy logic allows the development of complex control systems from the linguistic description of the knowledge of an expert operator, without any need to employ mathematical models, and provides good robustness in the face of changing operational conditions. For the design of the processing system, a MicroBlaze processor has been used [3]. This processor is available as an IP module together with a wide variety of peripherals, controllers and bus structures which allow the system to be configured according to the requirements of a particular application. MicroBlaze is a 32-bit RISC processor based on Harvard architecture, with separate buses for instructions and data and the possibility of using independent cache memories for both buses. This architecture is optimized for its implementation on FPGAs from Xilinx. Its instruction set includes 32-bit instructions with three operational elements and two direction modes. In Spartan 3, Virtex II and Virtex 4 families, the multiplication operations can be performed by hardware through the multipliers available in FPGAs. MicroBlaze uses a specific bus (LMB) in order to access the block memories available in the FPGA, whereas it employs IBM's standard OPB bus to connect external memory and peripherals. Finally, it has different FIFO canals for the connection of user functions. The Xfuzzy design environment facilitates the different stages of development of a fuzzy system. This includes description, simulation, and simplification tools which allow the fuzzy system to be defined, verified, and optimized. The environment also includes synthesis tools which provide hardware or software implementations of the inference system [4]. The hardware implementation of fuzzy inference modules has been carried out using the synthesis tool of the Xfuzzy environment named Xfvhdl [5]. This tool provides a VHDL description of the system according to an architecture specially optimized to run fuzzy systems through dedicated hardware [6]. Important characteristics of this architecture, which increase the efficiency of its digital realization, are: the use of an active rule-driven inference process, the limitation of the overlapping degree of membership function inputs and the use of simplified defuzzification methods. When the designer runs the synthesis process, he/she can choose different architectural and implementation options according to the particular characteristics of the problem. Concerning architecture, the designer can select the type of membership function generator (using an arithmetical technique or one based on memory), the operator used as connective (minimum or product), and the defuzzification method employed. Regarding the implementation on the FPGA, the designer can select the particular device that is going to be used and can choose the implementation of the different components of the knowledge bases as combinational logic or by storage in ROM or RAM memories. In this latter case it is possible to choose between using block type RAM or that associated to the FPGA CLBs [7]. As result, a VHDL description of the system is obtained, that can be synthesized with the tools from the Xilinx ISE environment. The EDK (Embedded Development Kit) development environment includes a group of IP components and tools that facilitate the development of embedded processing systems on FPGAs from Xilinx. The XPS (Xilinx Platform Studio) graphical user interface provides a group of templates that facilitate the development of peripherals which connect to the OPB bus. These templates are VHDL codes with two components: IPIF (Intellectual- property interconnect), which performs the interface functions with the OPB bus; and User\_logic which includes the logic developed by the user. In our case, this last file will include the VHDL description of the fuzzy controller given by Xfuzzy plus the code necessary to access the controller through the registers of the IP module. Both components communicate through the IPIC (Intellectual property interconnect) interface, which is independent of the peripheral bus. Different types of templates exist depending on the operational mode of the peripheral (master/slave) and the services provided by the IPIF block. The XPS graphical user interface also facilitates the generation of ".mdp" (microprocessor peripheral definition) and ".pao" (peripheral analyze order) files. These files are necessary for the use of the IP module in XPS as other peripherals of the system. The design cycle of a fuzzy controller as an IP module includes the following steps. Firstly, through the XPS assistant for creating peripherals, the name and peripheral version are indicated, together with the place where it is stored. The following step is to select which bus the peripheral will be attached to. Thirdly, different services implemented by the IPIF block are configured (user logic master/slave support, user logic interrupt support, number of registers, direct memory access, etc.). The following step is the implementation of the user logic. Finally, the last step is to import the existing peripheral. The XPS assistant for importing peripherals requires the inclusion of VHDL templates and library elements, the assignment of ports and the definition of parameters. When these steps have been completed the IP module can be used like any other peripheral in EDK. The proposed development technique is being employed in the design of a control system applied to the problem of parking autonomous vehicles. In this case the vehicle can be placed in a position close to the desired place of parking, in such a way that the trajectory to be taken must combine forward and backward movements. The proposed system uses a hierarchical knowledge base that includes modules for taking decisions (to decide if the vehicle must drive in one direction or another) and control modules (to calculate the speed and the steering wheel angle). The vehicle employed has sensors (encoders, gyroscope, etc.) and actuators (traction and direction engines) which enable the vehicle's speed, curvature, position and orientation values to be calculated. The global system has been implemented on a FPGA according to the hardware/software implementation strategy proposed in [8]. A general purpose processing system based on MicroBlaze deals with the communication with the robot actuators, the information acquisition from the sensors, and the processing of the speed, curvature, position and orientation of the vehicle. The inference mechanisms which perform the control heuristics are implemented by dedicated hardware according to the architecture previously mentioned. The experimental results shown in Figure 1 demonstrate that the proposed development technique is valid. Â© 2006 IEEE.},

The basic idea is to determine characteristics such as overlapping, intersection points and level of activation among the activated fuzzy sets in every control cycle. When compared to other techniques that use discrete universes of discourse, this exact aggregation and defuzzification method requires fewer operations, improving also the accuracy of the controller's output.

abstract = {In the last years, several intelligent systems have been deployed in mass-produced vehicles. The Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), intelligent infrastructures and au- tonomous driving maneuvers have significantly contributed to the implementation of intelligent systems both on the roads and in urban areas. Thanks to the research done by many groups and projects it is possible to find safer and more comfortable vehicles. Some examples are: Antilock Brake System (ABS), Cruise control (CC), Automatic parking and Electronic Stability Control (ESC), among others. At this time, it is not a utopia to think that, in a close future, autonomous vehicle will coexist with other conventional vehicles, interacting with them. In this work, a control architecture for autonomous vehicles have been tested, both for individual and cooperative maneuvers in urban and highway scenarios. Using previous contributions in the lateral and longitudinal control, different experiments have proved the modular control architecture, independently of the vehicle and the scenario used. To carry the validation, different platforms have been used: electric and gasoline-propelled vehicles. Straight and curve segments, blocked roads, commucations between infrastructure and vehicles and high speed experiments have been tested. Furthermore, the intelligent control system, based on fuzzy logic, that includes human knowledge, is easy to design and tune, and can be extended to different maneuvers. Â© 2013 IFAC.},

@article{Schwickart2015,
abstract = {This paper presents the design of a novel energy-efficient model-predictive cruise controller for electric vehicles as well a simulation model of the longitudinal vehicle dynamics and its energy consumption. Both, the controller and the dynamic model are designed to meet the properties of a series-production electric vehicle whose characteristics are identified and verified by measurements. A predictive eco-cruise controller involves the minimisation of a compromise between terms related to driving speed and energy consumption which are in general both described by nonlinear differential equations. Considering the nonlinearities is essential for a proper prediction of the system states over the prediction horizon to achieve the desired energy-saving behaviour. In this work, the vehicle motion equation is reformulated in terms of the kinetic energy of the moving vehicle which leads to a linear differential equation without loss of information. The energy consumption is modeled implicitly by exploiting the special form of the optimisation problem. The reformulations finally lead to a model-predictive control approach with quadratic cost function, linear prediction model and linear constraints that corresponds to a piecewise linear system behaviour and allows a fast real-time implementation with guaranteed convergence. Simulation results of the MPC controller and the simulation model in closed-loop operation finally provide a proof of concept.},

abstract = {Adaptive cruise control (ACC) of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) has been traditionally developed without an efficient integration with active safety and energy management systems of hybrid powertrains, mainly for facilitating its implementation. This, however, leads to a compromise in the fuel economy of HEVs, since the predictive driving information provided by ACC is not exploited by the energy management system. In order to enhance the energy efficiency and control system integration, a novel ACC system for intelligent HEVs (i-HEV ACC) is developed in this study. The controller is proposed within the framework of nonlinear model predictive control, and a position-based nonlinear longitudinal intervehicle dynamics model is developed. A coordinated optimal control problem for both the tracking safety and the fuel consumption is formulated subject to the constraints on stable tracking. A multistep offline dynamic programming optimization and an online lookup table are used to implement the real-time control algorithm. Experiments are further conducted, which demonstrate that the proposed i-HEV ACC achieves enhanced performance and cooperation in traffic safety, fuel efficiency, and ride comfort.},

Due to the presence of nonlinearity in the vehicle (system), it is difficult to design an exact mathematical model of the system. Heuristic based fuzzy logic controller with optimized rule base, which does not require accurate mathematical modelling is proposed here which uses the knowledge of the designer for developing the rule base. The performance metrics in terms of better control and response time of the controller depends upon how well the rule base is formulated. More the number of rules in the rule base, higher the search time and increase in the total response time of the system but better will be the control. On the other hand, if the rules are less, then the search time will reduce which in turn decreases the total time of response of the system but control will be poor.

abstract = {Many attributes contribute to product failures that result in warranty claims. In particular, there are situations where several attributes are used together as criteria for judging the warranty eligibility of a failed product. For example, automobiles warranty coverage has both age and mileage limits. The warranty policy characterized by a region in a two-dimensional plane with one axis representing product age and the other axis representing product usage is known as the "two-attribute" warranty policy. A number of procedures have been developed for analyzing the two-dimensional warranty policy. These procedures use many crisp data obtained from strictly controlled reliability tests. However, in real situations, these requirements might not be fulfilled. In extreme cases, the warranty claims data come from users whose reports are expressed in a vague way. This may be due to subjective and imprecise perception of failures by a user, imprecise warranty data record, or imprecise rate of usage record. This paper suggests fuzziness as an alternative to randomness for describing the two-dimensional warranty uncertainty. A new sets-as-points geometric view of fuzzy warranty sets is developed in this study. This view can reduce many errors of estimation and prediction of the cost associated with a variety of warranty policies including the "two-attribute" warranties and some reliability improvement warranties.

This result motivates us to use the fuzzy identifiers for nonlinear dynamic systems and then design the fuzzy supervised nonlinear PID controller based on the fuzzy system. There are two main objectives in this paper: (1) We use the Takagi and Sugeno's fuzzy models as an identifier for nonlinear dynamic systems, and derive the identification algorithm, (2) the fuzzy supervisor design method for tracking control is proposed based on this fuzzy system. In order to improve the dynamic response of the closed loop fuzzy model, the optimization of the performance of the fuzzy supervisor will be considered. To prove the potential applications of the proposed strategy, simulation was carried out for the speed control of a DC motor with serial excitation and a first order nonlinear process.

abstract = {This paper proposed an adaptive neuro-fuzzy model (ANFIS) to multilevel inverter (MLI) for grid connected photovoltaic (PV) system. The purpose of the proposed controller is that it is not requiring any optimal pulse width modulated (PWM) switching-angle generator and proportional-integral controller. The proposed method strictly prohibits the variations present in the output voltage of the cascaded H-bridge MLI. In this method, the ANFIS have the input which is grid voltage, the difference voltage and the output target is control voltage. By using these parameters, the ANFIS makes the rules and has been tuned perfectly. During the testing time, the ANFIS gives the control voltage according to the different inputs. The resultant control voltage equivalent gate pulses are utilized for controlling the insulated gate bi-polar switches (IGBT) of MLI. Then the ANFIS based MLI for grid connected PV system is implemented in the MATLAB/simulink platform and the effectiveness of the proposed control technique is analyzed by comparing with the neural network (NN), fuzzy logic control, etc. The comparison results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach and confirm its potential to solve the problem. A prototype of three-phase grid connected cascaded H-bridge inverter has been developed using field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and results are analyzed.},

abstract = {A compiler is frequently unable to make use of algorithm-specific instructions which DSP's (digital signal processors) provide. To force their use, programmers use language extensions to define intrinsic functions. Traditionally, these intrinsic functions are implemented with assembly language instructions on the target processor. We propose and implement a new approach to intrinsic functions where the programmer targets a compiler's intermediate representation rather than the assembly language of a particular processor. The benefits of our approach are both portability and improved performance. We compare the performance of the traditional approach with our new approach for four GSM (Global System for Mobile communication) speech coders. We also examine the interaction of our new approach with two major optimizations-profile-directed function inlining and agressive loop optimization. We find that, compared to the traditional approach, our benefits greatly from removing barriers to these optimizations. We find that without inlining or loop optimization, our new approach speeds up execution by a factor of 1.12 compared to the traditional approach; however, with both loop optimization and a moderate amount of inlining, we find a speedup of 2.38. We find a similar improvement in achieved instruction-level parallelism.},

abstract = {Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems are appropriate tools to deal with classification problems due to their good properties. However, they can suffer a lack of system accuracy as a result of the uncertainty inherent in the definition of the membership functions and the limitation of the homogeneous distribution of the linguistic labels. The aim of the paper is to improve the performance of Fuzzy Rule-Based Classification Systems by means of the Theory of Interval-Valued Fuzzy Sets and a post-processing genetic tuning step. In order to build the Interval-Valued Fuzzy Sets we define a new function called weak ignorance for modeling the uncertainty associated with the definition of the membership functions. Next, we adapt the fuzzy partitions to the problem in an optimal way through a cooperative evolutionary tuning in which we handle both the degree of ignorance and the lateral position (based on the 2-tuples fuzzy linguistic representation) of the linguistic labels. The experimental study is carried out over a large collection of data-sets and it is supported by a statistical analysis. Our results show empirically that the use of our methodology outperforms the initial Fuzzy Rule-Based Classification System. The application of our cooperative tuning enhances the results provided by the use of the isolated tuning approaches and also improves the behavior of the genetic tuning based on the 3-tuples fuzzy linguistic representation. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Experimental results have shown remarkable tracking performance of this fuzzy PID controller, and have convincingly demonstrated that fuzzy logic control can be used for flexible-joint robot arms with uncertainties and it is quite robust. In this paper, the fuzzy PID controller is first described briefly, using a simple and practical PD+I controller configuration. This configuration preserves the linear structure of the conventional PD+I controller, but has nonconstant gains: the proportional, integral, and derivative gains are nonlinear functions of their input signals, which have self-tuning (adaptive) capabilities in setpoint tracking performance. Moreover, these variable gains make the fuzzy PID controller robust with faster response time and less overshoot than its conventional counterpart. The proposed design was tested using a flexible-joint robot arm driven by a dc motor in a laboratory, where the arm was experienced with time-varying loads. Control performance by the conventional and fuzzy PID controllers for such a laboratory robotic system are both included in this paper for comparison. Â© 1997 IEEE.},

This paper discusses a design strategy that eases the implementation of embedded fuzzy controllers as systems on programmable chips. The development of the controllers is carried out by means of a reconfigurable platform based on field-programmable gate arrays. This platform combines specific hardware to implement fuzzy inference modules with a general-purpose processor, thus allowing the realization of hybrid hardware/software solutions. As happens to the components of the processing system, the specific fuzzy elements are conceived as configurable intellectual property modules in order to accelerate the controller design cycle. The design methodology and tool chain presented in this paper have been applied to the realization of a control system for solving the navigation tasks of an autonomous vehicle.},

abstract = {One of the main advantages of fuzzy systems is their ability to design comprehensible models of real-world systems, thanks to the use of a fuzzy rule structure easily interpretable by human beings. This is especially useful for the design of fuzzy logic controllers, where the knowledge base can be extracted from expert knowledge. Even more, the availability of a readable structure allows the human expert to customize the fuzzy controller to different environments by manually tuning its components. Nevertheless, this tuning task is usually a time-consuming procedure when done manually, especially when several measures are considered to evaluate the controller performance, and thus the interest in the design of automatic tuning procedures for fuzzy systems has increased along the last few years. In this paper, we tackle the tuning of the fuzzy membership functions of a fuzzy visual system for autonomous robots. This fuzzy visual system is based on a hierarchical structure of three different fuzzy classifiers, whose combined action allows the robot to detect the presence of doors in the images captured by its camera. Although the global knowledge represented in the fuzzy system knowledge base makes it perform properly in the door detection task, its adaptation to the specific conditions of the environment where the robot is operating can significantly improve the classification accuracy. However, the tuning procedure is complex as two different performance indexes are involved in the optimization process (true positive and false positive detections), thus becoming a multiobjective problem. Hence, in order to automatically put the fuzzy system tuning into effect, different single and multiobjective evolutionary algorithms are considered to optimize the two criteria, and their behavior in problem solving is compared.},

With a$\backslash$nhuman being involved, the performance and even the safety and stability$\backslash$nof the GC operation is subject to human errors. Focusing on this$\backslash$npractical challenge, this paper proposes an intelligence-based$\backslash$nsupervisory control strategy that consists of a control loop set-point$\backslash$noptimization module, an artificial neural network-based soft-sensor$\backslash$nmodule, a fuzzy logic-based dynamic adjustor, and an expert-based$\backslash$noverload diagnosis and adjustment module to perform the control tasks$\backslash$nfor the GC system. This hybrid system can automatically adjust the$\backslash$nset-points for the DCS-controlled grinding system in response to the$\backslash$nchanges in boundary conditions or the imminent overload conditions,$\backslash$nthereby eliminating the need for an operator. Practical applications$\backslash$nhave shown the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Systems are equipments usually implemented for maintaining satisfactory comfort conditions in buildings. The design of Fuzzy Logic Controllers (FLCs) for HVAC Systems is usually based on the operator's experience. However, an initial rule set drawn from the expert's experience sometimes fail to obtain satisfactory results, since inefficient or redundant rules are usually found in the final Rule Base. Moreover, in our case, the system being controlled is too complex and an optimal controller behavior is required. Rule selection methods directly obtain a subset of rules from a given fuzzy rule set, removing inefficient and redundant rules and, thereby, enhancing the controller interpretability, robustness, flexibility and control capability. On the other hand, different parameter optimization techniques could be applied to improve the system accuracy by inducing a better cooperation among the rules composing the final Rule Base. In this chapter, we present a study of how several tuning approaches can be applied and combined with a rule selection method to obtain more compact and accurate FLCs concerning energy performance and indoor comfort requirements of a HVAC system.

The quality of the discharge in the Saskatchewan TORus-Modified (STOR-M) tokamak is strongly related to the position of the plasma column within the discharge vessel. If the plasma column approaches too near the wall, then either minor or complete disruption occurs. Consequently it is necessary to be able to control dynamically the position of the plasma column throughout the entire discharge. A fuzzy-logic-based controller was designed and implemented for this purpose. This controller was evaluated on the STOR-M tokamak during actual operation, and was found to provide reliably a high quality of control. The actual performance of the fuzzy-logic-based controller at actually controlling the position of the plasma column within the STOR-M tokamak is evaluated against the actual performance of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller.

This force deals with nonlinear uncertainties due to the mechanical properties and it depends on the final torque and relative angular position of the bolt/nut connection. This paper handles the control problem of automated bolt tightening processes. To develop a controller, the process is divided into four stages, according to the mechanical characteristics of the bolt/nut connection: a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) with expert knowledge of tightening process and error detection capability is proposed. For each one of the four stages, an individual FLC is designed to address the highly nonlinearity of the system and the error scenarios related to that stage, to promptly prevent and avoid mechanical damage. The FLC is implemented and real time executed on an industrial PC and finally validated. Experimental results show the performance of the controller to reach precise torque and angle levels as well as desired clamping force. The capability of error detection is also validated.},

abstract = {In this paper, a novel real time non-linear model predictive controller (NMPC) for a multi-variable coupled tank system (CTS) is designed. CTSs are highly non-linear and can be found in many industrial process applications. The involvement of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system makes the design of an effective controller a challenging task. MIMO systems have inherent couplings, interactions in-between the process input-output variables and generally have an complex internal structure. The aim of this paper is to design, simulate, and implement a novel real time constrained NMPC for a multi-variable CTS with the aid of intelligent system techniques. There are two major formidable challenges hindering the success of the implementation of a NMPC strategy in the MIMO case. The first is the difficulty of obtaining a good non-linear model by training a non-convex complex network to avoid being trapped in a local minimum solution. The second is the online real time optimisation (RTO) of the manipulated variable at every sampling time. A novel wavelet neural network (WNN) with high predicting precision and time-frequency localisation characteristic was selected for an MIMO model and a fast stochastic wavelet gradient algorithm was used for initial training of the network. Furthermore, a genetic algorithm was used to obtain the optimised parameters of the WNN as well as the RTO during the NMPC strategy. The proposed strategy performed well in both simulation and real time on an MIMO CTS. The results indicated that WNN provided better trajectory regulation with less mean-squared-error and average control energy compared to an artificial neural network. It is also shown that the WNN is more robust during abnormal operating conditions.},

abstract = {A dual adaptation generalized predictive controller (DA-GPC) capable of synchronous modeling and tuning in real time is proposed. The distinctive feature of the proposed controller is the utilization of a second order discrete time controlled auto-regressive integrated moving average (CARIMA) model to capture all possible variations of numerator dynamics via the variable forgetting factor recursive least squares (VFF-RLS) algorithm. The evolving dynamic model is then used to tune, in real time, the value of the move suppression weight. Simulation studies on two benchmark process control problems, i.e., the Van de Vusse nonlinear isothermal stirred tank reactor (with dead time) and the strong acid-base neutralization process, revealed the improved performance of the DA-GPC scheme over the traditional model adaptive GPC and the conventional GPC schemes in terms of set point tracking. Further simulation studies revealed that the DA-GPC scheme was adept in rejecting load disturbances in the process. The good performance attained was attributed to the judicious adaptation of the move suppression weight. Moreover, a user-friendly aspect of the DA-GPC scheme is that the only parameter requiring manual tuning is the VFF-RLS parameter ($\sigma$), which may span a large range without materially affecting the efficacy of this adaptive controller.

In mineral processing, in particular, several applications of conventional MPC can be found for the individual processes of crushing, grinding, flotation, thickening, agglomeration, and smelting with varying degrees of success depending on the variables involved and the control objectives. Given the complexity of the processes normally found in mineral processing, there is also great interest in the design and development of advanced control techniques which aim to deal with situations that conventional controllers are unable to do. In this aspect, Hybrid MPC enables the representation of systems, incorporating logical variables, rules, and continuous dynamics. This paper firstly presents a framework for modeling and representation of hybrid systems, and the design and development of hybrid predictive controllers. Additionally, two application examples in mineral processing are presented. Results through simulation show that the control schemes developed under this framework exhibit a better performance when compared with conventional expert or MPC controllers, while providing a highly systematized methodology for the analysis, design, and development of hybrid MPC controllers.},

abstract = {This paper presents a study on the design of linear model predictive control (MPC) for wind turbines, with a focus on the controller's tuning tradeoffs. A continuously linearized MPC approach is described and applied to control a 3-bladed, horizontal axis, variable speed wind turbine. The tuning involves a multiobjective cost function so that the performance can be optimized with respect to five defined measures: power variation, pitch usage, tower displacement, drivetrain twist and frequency of violating the nominal power limit. A tuning approach based on the computation of sensitivity tables is proposed and tested via numerical simulations using a nonlinear turbine model. The paper further compares the performance of the MPC controller with that of a conventional one.},

abstract = {An important area of cyber-physical systems research is the development of smart ground transportation systems due to their potentially significant impact on safety, the economy, and the environment. We propose an approach based on model predictive control (MPC) for the development of provably collision free autonomous ground transportation systems, and present an autonomous intersection management framework. The MPC approach enables a vehicle to generate its own motion locally in time based on an optimization framework, incorporating constraints based on the states of other vehicles in the neighborhood, the speed limit of a road, the maximum values of acceleration and deceleration, etc. Safety and liveness of the traffic are however system-wide properties, not merely neighborhood properties, and the challenge is to augment this distributed optimization with coordination rules that guarantee overall system-wide safety as well as liveness of the traffic. We design two vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) coordination rules, along with a vehicle-to-infrastructure rule, and establish the system-wide safety and liveness of the autonomous traffic based on each vehicle's MPC motion planner, operating in conjunction with an algorithm that orders vehicles according to their runtime properties. We also conduct a comparative simulation study of the throughput performance at an intersection of the above approach against another popular algorithm, the All-Way STOP.},

abstract = {Reduction of contour error, which is defined as the shortest distance between the actual position of the cutting tool and the reference trajectory, is an essential requirement in machining by multiaxis feed drive systems. In addition, because these machines operate all the time in industrial applications all over the world, reduction of the consumed energy in these machines contributes to environmental, natural resources, and energy problems. This paper presents a novel sliding mode contouring controller with a nonlinear sliding surface to improve the machining accuracy of the biaxial feed drive systems. Because the contour error is more important than the tracking error with respect to each feed drive axis, the contour error component is included in the proposed sliding surface. The advantage of including the contour error in the proposed sliding surface is that the damping ratio of the system changes from its initial low value to final high value as the contour error changes from high value to small value and vice versa. Hence, the proposed algorithm allows a closed-loop system to simultaneously achieve low energy consumption and small settling time, resulting in a smaller error. By using the proposed method, experimental results for a biaxial feed drive system show a significant performance improvement in terms of the contour error. In addition, the proposed approach reduces the control input variance by about 41.2$\backslash$\% and 14.9$\backslash$\% for x-and y-axis, respectively, and consumed energy by about 23.7$\backslash$\% and 5.5$\backslash$\% for the respective axis from the conventional method with a linear sliding surface.},

abstract = {In this work, in-depth considerations about FPGA-CPU architectures design methods are presented together with some possible plant applications. FPGAs are used because of their potentials in guaranteeing parallelism, synchronism and high reliability tasks; on the other hand CPUs are crucial to higher precision computations and to reproduce data and results on a graphical interface, thus resulting in an improvement in the human-machine-interface (HMI). Design choices are here reported to justify the benefits from the use of both CPU-FPGA approaches. Taking advantage of these features, the LabVIEW environment and its digital platform is expanded in order to develop a novel tool able to support designers during the fundamental phases of a supervision and control tool realization: from the model development to the digital hardware implementation and testing. LabVIEW is able to communicate with several languages like Matlab or Scilab for a theoretical model study and simulation, and VHDL for a digital implementation, taking the advantages from both development environments. Main results have been reported concerning studies of control systems in nuclear plant facilities, showing how a fulldigital platform can be very useful in developing monitoring and control instrumentation. This new tool is thought to improve the so-called hardware in the loop (HIL) simulations and to accelerate the process of prototypes implementation and testing, using a more accurate and reliable environment in terms of performance and safety.

The accuracy simulation results of the DPF and normal fuzzification method are presented and compared to show the superiority of the DPF. As the word-length is the most important parameter in a finite-precision implementation environment which determines the system cost-precision trade-off, the simulation results show that DPF provides suitable precision improvements with respect to traditional fuzzification without increasing the system word-length. The VLSI synthesis results of both methods are also presented to show that this considerable accuracy improvement is achieved by an acceptable increase in its VLSI implementation costs in terms of area, delay, and power consumption with respect to traditional methods.

A genetic algorithm (GA) is used to estimate the fuzzy systems which capture low complexity and minimal rule base. Optimization of the âentropyâ of a fuzzy rule base leads to a minimal number of rules, of membership functions and of subpremises together with an optimal input/output (I/O) behavior. Most of the resulting fuzzy systems are comparable to systems designed by an expert but offers a better performance.

abstract = {This paper presents a VHDL-AMS based genetic optimization methodology suitable for performance improvement of hardware systems in automotive applications. Models of such systems are mixedsignal (analog and digital) in which the analog parts cover mixed physical domains. A case study applying this novel method to the fuzzy logic controller (FLC) optimization in an automotive active suspension system (AASS) has been investigated. A new type of fuzzy logic membership functions with variable geometrical shapes has been proposed and optimized. In this optimization technique, VHDL-AMS is used not only for the modeling and simulation of the FLC and its underlying AASS but also for the implementation of a parallel genetic algorithm (GA). This has resulted in an integrated performance optimization system wholly implemented in the hardware description language (HDL). Results show that the proposed FLC has superior performance to that of existing FLCs that use fixed-shape membership functions.},

The domain of traffic and transportation systems is well suited for an agent-based approach because transportation systems are usually geographically distributed in dynamic changing environments. Our literature survey shows that the techniques and methods resulting from the field of agent and multiagent systems have been applied to many aspects of traffic and transportation systems, including modeling and simulation, dynamic routing and congestion management, and intelligent traffic control. This paper examines an agent-based approach and its applications in different modes of transportation, including roadway, railway, and air transportation. This paper also addresses some critical issues in developing agent-based traffic control and management systems, such as interoperability, flexibility, and extendibility. Finally, several future research directions toward the successful deployment of agent technology in traffic and transportation systems are discussed.},

abstract = {In this paper, an adaptive configuration for PID type fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is proposed to improve the performances of both conventional PID (C-PID) controller and conventional PID type FLC (C-PID-FLC). The proposed configuration is called adaptive because its output scaling factors (SFs) are dynamically tuned while the controller is functioning. The initial values of SFs are calculated based on its well-tuned counterpart while the proceeding values are generated using a proposed stochastic hybrid bacterial foraging particle swarm optimization (h-BF-PSO) algorithm. The performance of the proposed configuration is evaluated through extensive simulations for different operating conditions (changes in reference, load disturbance and noise signals). The results reveal that the proposed scheme performs significantly better over the C-PID controller and the C-PID-FLC in terms of several performance indices (integral absolute error (IAE), integral-of-time-multiplied absolute error (ITAE) and integral-of-time-multiplied squared error (ITSE)), overshoot and settling time for plants with and without dead time.},

abstract = {An interval type-2 fuzzy set (IT2 FS) is characterized by its upper and lower membership functions containing all possible embedded fuzzy sets, which together is referred to as the footprint of uncertainty (FOU). The FOU results in a span of uncertainty measured in the defuzzified space and is determined by the positional difference of the centroids of all the embedded fuzzy sets taken together. This paper provides a closed-form formula to evaluate the span of uncertainty of an IT2 FS. The closed-form formula offers a precise measurement of the degree of uncertainty in an IT2 FS with a runtime complexity less than that of the classical iterative Karnik-Mendel algorithm and other formulations employing the iterative Newton-Raphson algorithm. This paper also demonstrates a real-time control application using the proposed closed-form formula of centroids with reduced root mean square error and computational overhead than those of the existing methods. Computer simulations for this real-time control application indicate that parallel realization of the IT2 defuzzification outperforms its competitors with respect to maximum overshoot even at high sampling rates. Furthermore, in the presence of measurement noise in system (plant) states, the proposed IT2 FS based scheme outperforms its type-1 counterpart with respect to peak overshoot and root mean square error in plant response.},

abstract = {Power line communication (PLC) systems are being standardized over the globe and some of these standards recommended frequency shift keying (FSK) as their modulation choice. Broadband transmission over a PLC channel is mainly affected by the ever-present background noise and the occasional high-amplitude impulses. It has been recently found that the background noise in PLC can be suitably modelled with Nakagami-m distribution while a standard model for characterizing impulses is to assume Gaussian distributed amplitude and Poisson distributed arrivals. Considering such a model, at first, simple analytical bit error rate (BER) expressions of uncoded binary FSK (BFSK) signals are derived in the paper. The derived expressions are simple, involve only elementary functions, and the analytical BER values match perfectly with computer simulations. Next, a unified analytical framework is presented for evaluating BER when a Reed Solomon (RS) code is used to mitigate the noise effects. The results reveal that when the signal to background noise ratio (SBNR) is low, there is a clear impact of the noise parameter m and the choice of demodulation method (coherent/non-coherent) on the error performance of the coded system. On the contrary, at higher SBNR, impulsive noise dominates over background noise, and these effects vanish as the BER curves become flat. Numerical evaluations dictated that by allowing a lower code rate (0.7) this error floor may be reduced significantly (up to 10-15). Further, the code gain of the system was found to be an inverse function of the code rate and codeword length.},

Consequently, the compensators C in CCC are commonly implemented in a

overcome the CCC design limitations described above, this paper
introduces a robust CCC design based on a novel formulation: the
contouring error transfer function (CETF), leading to an equivalent
formulation as in the feedback control design problem. Then, methods in
robust control design can be readily employed to achieve robust CCC with
specified stability margins and guaranteed contouring performance.
Furthermore, the proposed design has been verified as being internally

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach of artificial intelligence
(AI) techniques, viz. fuzzy logic, artificial neural network (ANN) and
hybrid fuzzy neural network (HFNN) for the automatic generation control
(AGC). The limitations of the conventional controls, viz. proportional,
integral and derivative (PID) are slow and lack of efficiency in
handling system nonlinearities. The primary purpose of the AGC is to
balance the total system generation against system load and losses so
that the desired frequency and power interchange with neighboring
systems is maintained. Any mismatch between generation and demand causes
the system frequency to deviate from scheduled value. Thus high
frequency deviation may lead to system collapse. This necessitates an
accurate and fast acting controller to maintain constant nominal
frequency. The intelligent controllers, viz. fuzzy logic, ANN and hybrid
fuzzy neural network approaches are used for automatic generation
control for the single area system and two area interconnected power
systems. The performance of the intelligent controllers has been
compared with the conventional PI and PID controllers for the single
area system as well as two-area interconnected power system. The results
shows that hybrid fuzzy neural network (HFNN) controller has better

improved control in several situations. This implementation avoids the

Due to PID controllers' widespread use in industry, tuning procedures for them are always a topic of interest. In this dissertation, it is proposed that the controller be tuned using the Genetic Algorithm technique. Using genetic algorithms to perform the tuning of the controller will result in the optimum controller being evaluated for the system every time. For this study, the model selected is a fault tolerant system. The PID controller of the model will be designed using the classical method and the results analyzed. The same model will be redesigned using the GA method. The results of both designs will be compared, analyzed and conclusion will be drawn out of the simulation made. Then the optimized Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)Controller is evolved using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)technology. The algorithm is implemented using Distributed Arithmetic (DA)-based scheme where a Look-Up-Table (LUT) mechanism inside the FPGA is utilized. Twonovel DA-based PID controllers have been proposed for FPGAimplementation. The implementation results show that, the twoDA methods require 13\% and 4\% of logic devices, respectively,compared to the design using multipliers. Furthermore, thepower consumption is reduced by about 40\%. A design whichis efficient in terms of power consumption and chip areawhile having adequate speed means that the FPGA chip canbe used to accommodate more controllers with low powerconsumption, resulting in a cost reduction of the controllerhardware.

abstract = {This paper deals with the design of a novel fuzzy proportionalâintegralâderivative (PID) controller for automatic generation control (AGC) of a two unequal area interconnected thermal system. For the first time teachingâlearning based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is applied in this area to obtain the parameters of the proposed fuzzy-PID controller. The design problem is formulated as an optimization problem and TLBO is employed to optimize the parameters of the fuzzy-PID controller. The superiority of proposed approach is demonstrated by comparing the results with some of the recently published approaches such as Lozi map based chaotic optimization algorithm (LCOA), genetic algorithm (GA), pattern search (PS) and simulated algorithm (SA) based PID controller for the same system under study employing the same objective function. It is observed that TLBO optimized fuzzy-PID controller gives better dynamic performance in terms of settling time, overshoot and undershoot in frequency and tie-line power deviation as compared to LCOA, GA, PS and SA based PID controllers. Further, robustness of the system is studied by varying all the system parameters from â50\% to +50\% in step of 25\%. Analysis also reveals that TLBO optimized fuzzy-PID controller gains are quite robust and need not be reset for wide variation in system parameters.},

In this research, a banana fruit was chosen to show the viability of this system. The Fuzzy Inference System grades a banana based on the extracted features that are obtained using Image Processing techniques of several images of each fruit. Since, this grading process requires a high speed processor, a typical computer platform is not a perfect choice.

abstract = {Tokamaks are the most promising devices for obtaining nuclear fusion energy from high-temperature, ionized gas termed as Plasma. The successful operation of tokamak depends on its ability to confine plasma at the geometric center of vacuum vessel with sufficient stability. The quality of plasma discharge in ADITYA Tokamak is strongly related to the radial position of the plasma column in the vacuum vessel. If the plasma column approaches too near to the wall of vacuum vessel, it leads to minor or complete disruption of plasma. Hence the control of plasma position throughout the entire plasma discharge duration is a fundamental requirement. This paper describes Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) which is designed for radial plasma position control. This controller is tested and evaluated on the ADITYA RZIP control model. The performance of this FLC was compared with that of Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Controller and the response was found to be faster and smoother.

Thirty-two experiments were used to train ANFIS, and the trained model was subsequently tested on ten experiments that were additionally conducted.

Prediction performance of the ANFIS model was optimized as a function of training factors: type of membership function and learning factors. Root mean-squared prediction errors of optimized ANFIS models are 0.308 \&amp;mu;m/min, 0.305, and 1.371 \&amp;Aring;, for etch rate, anisotropy, and CD bias, respectively.

transforms to order and select rules in a fuzzy rule base. The
techniques are well-known from linear algebra, and we comment on their
usefulness in fuzzy modeling. The application of rank-revealing methods
based on singular value decomposition (SVD) to rule reduction gives
rather conservative results. They are essentially subset selection
methods, and we show that such methods do not produce an

the literature. The orthogonal least-squares (OLS) method, which
evaluates the contribution of the rules to the output, is more
attractive for systems modeling. However, it has been shown to sometimes
assign high importance to rules that are correlated in the premise. This
hampers the generalization capabilities of the resulting model. We
discuss the performance of rank-revealing reduction methods and advocate
the use of a less complex method based on the pivoted QR decomposition.
Further, we show how detection of redundant rules can be introduced in
OLS by a simple extension of the algorithm. The methods are applied to a

@article{Balasubramaniam2006,
abstract = {Following the wide spread usage of Fuzzy Systems, Rule Reduction has emerged as one of the most important areas of research in the field of Fuzzy Control. Many rule reduction methods have been proposed in the literature and can be broadly classified into Lossless or Lossy with respect to the inference, based on whether the outputs of the original and the reduced rule bases are identical or not. In a typical Multi-Input-Single-Output fuzzy system the number of rules far exceeds the number of fuzzy sets defined on the output domain. This suggests that the rule base can be partitioned into sets of rules, each set being mapped to a single consequent fuzzy set. In this paper, we investigate the conditions on the inference operators employed in a fuzzy system that enable "lossless" merging of rules with identical consequents. After briefly surveying the many techniques that have been proposed towards reducing the number of rules, we propose a general framework for Inference in Fuzzy Systems and then propose some sufficiency conditions on this general framework that give us a class of Fuzzy Systems that allow lossless rule reduction of the type mentioned above. We then explore these conditions in the setting of Fuzzy Logic. We find that R- and S-implications play a very critical role. We give examples from the above class of Fuzzy Systems. In this study we apply the above technique only on rules whose antecedents and consequents are fuzzy sets.},

abstract = {Many industrial processes and physical systems are spatially distributed systems. Recently, a novel 3-D FLC was developed for such systems. The previous study on the 3-D FLC was concentrated on an expert knowledge-based approach. However, in most of situations, we may lack the expert knowledge, while input-output data sets hidden with effective control laws are usually available. Under such circumstance, a data-driven approach could be a very effective way to design the 3-D FLC. In this study, we aim at developing a new 3-D FLC design methodology based on clustering and support vector machine (SVM) regression. The design consists of three parts: initial rule generation, rule-base simplification, and parameter learning. Firstly, the initial rules are extracted by a nearest neighborhood clustering algorithm with Frobenius norm as a distance. Secondly, the initial rule-base is simplified by merging similar 3-D fuzzy sets and similar 3-D fuzzy rules based on similarity measure technique. Thirdly, the consequent parameters are learned by a linear SVM regression algorithm. Additionally, the universal approximation capability of the proposed 3-D fuzzy system is discussed. Finally, the control of a catalytic packed-bed reactor is taken as an application to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 3-D FLC design. Â© 2012 Xian-xia Zhang et al.},

to search for redundancy in the rule base description. As a result, we
propose an iterative fuzzy identification technique starting with
data-based fuzzy clustering with an overestimated number of local
models. The GA is then applied to find redundancy among the local models
with a criterion based on maximal accuracy and maximal set similarity.
After the reduction steps, the GA is applied with another criterion
searching for minimal set similarity and maximal accuracy. This results
in an automatic identification scheme with fuzzy clustering, rule base
simplification and constrained genetic optimization with low-human
intervention. The proposed modeling approach is then demonstrated for a
system identification and a classification problem},

Similar fuzzy sets are merged to create a common fuzzy set to replace them in the rule base. If the redundancy in the model is high, merging similar fuzzy sets might result in equal rules that also can be merged, thereby reducing the number of rules as well.

abstract = {An important issue in fuzzy-rule-based modeling is how to select a set of important fuzzy rules from a given rule base. Even though it is conceivable that removal of redundant or less important fuzzy rules from the rule base can result in a compact fuzzy model with better generalizing ability, the decision as to which rules are redundant or less important is not an easy exercise. In this paper, we introduce several orthogonal transformation-based methods that provide new or alternative tools for rule selection. These methods include an orthogonal least squares (OLS) method, an eigenvalue decomposition (ED) method, a singular value decomposition and QR with column pivoting (SVD-QR) method, a total least squares (TLS) method, and a direct singular value decomposition (D-SVD) method. A common attribute of these methods is that they all work on a firing strength matrix and employ some measure index to detect the rules that should be retained and eliminated. We show the performance of these methods by applying them to solving a nonlinear plant modeling problem. Our conclusions based on analysis and simulation can be used as a guideline for choosing a proper rule selection method for a specific application.},

abstract = {Studies on complexity reduction for simplifying fuzzy rule-based
models using the orthogonal transformation method are described, where
the output space as well as the input space are considered. Generally,
the conventional clustering algorithms are applied only to data set of
input space. In some applications, data set of the output space is
integrated into the input space and clustering is performed jointly.
However, in this case the essential role of the output in the model is
overlooked. This situation can be improved by using clustering methods
where both spaces are used in the clustering process. One such a model
is radial basis function network (RBFN) where clusters can be determined
by the orthogonal least squares (OLS) algorithm. The OLS algorithm is an
orthogonal transformation method using the Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalisation process. The present work describes the implementation
of OLS algorithm along the principal components of the RBFN-matrix and
shows that the method itself is equivalent to complexity reduction where
basis functions are in effect orthogonal. The main implication of this
is the essential enhancement on the effectiveness of clustering.
Furthermore, an important computational gain is achieved by the
simplification of the complexity reduction process at the moderate
expense of computing principal components},

The method used is principal component analysis complemented with the OLS method for the selection of the rules. In this selection process, first, the regression matrix of a common radial basis function (RBF) network is considered. The magnitude of the eigenvalues of the RBF matrix of radial basis function network is not central to the selection. The selection is made according to the energy contribution from the graded principal components, where eigenvectors with low eigenvalues may have relatively more energy contribution to the output depending on the model outputs. In parallel to the above gradation process, the influential basis functions are identified, as they are associated with the graded principal components of higher ranks in this very gradation. This approach is extended to normalized RBF matrix for fuzzy systems with singular value decomposition. The comparative results are presented and the implication and importance of the approach is pointed out.},

However, principal limitation of Residue Number System is the slow and complex nature for arithmetic operations viz. division, comparison, sign detection and overflow detection and rejection. In this paper we have described some novel approaches to grapple with the limitations of comparison, sign detection and averting overflow. The selection of moduli in RNS is most important in attaining to solutions of problems as described earlier. Accordingly, a set of moduli is selected.

For verification, the response of load frequency control using fuzzy based governor and PID based governor is compared. The simulation results show that fuzzy based governor ensures robust control by improving the frequency response as well as dynamic response in comparison to PID based governor. Furthermore, fuzzy based governor enables the generator to continuously supply power even at 25\% load variation whereas generator with PID based governor fails to supply power even at 20\% load variation.

Both hardware and software approaches have been adopted to increase the speed of operation of the fuzzy processors in general and inference processing in particular. To improve the inference processing, the calculation of matching degree (MD) between the fuzzified input and the antecedent membership functions (MF) has to improve, as it needs very high latency and limits the overall inference performance. In this paper, a novel architecture of a MAX-MIN circuit, used for calculating the MD between two Gaussian-shaped MF's, used first time, has been proposed. The proposed architecture is area, power, speed efficient and flexible in comparison to existing architectures using trapezoid-MF, as the number of multiplexing and subtracting operations has been reduced.

Winner-Take-All circuits were developed to build the fuzzifier. The
fuzzifier generates the membership functions of a fuzzy system by
converting the input analog signals to their corresponding predetermined
grad of memberships. It takes voltage-mode inputs and produces current
mode outputs for easy manipulations of the output fuzzy signals by the
arithmetic operations that follow. Furthermore, the fuzzifier is so
flexible that it can be readily adapted into most fuzzy systems,
including neural networks, by changing the reference voltages and the
number of building blocks used. The high speed of analog implementation
also makes this fuzzifier more attractive than software approaches},

In the proposed work a robust background modeling algorithm using fuzzy logic is used to detect foreground objects. Three distinct features are extracted from the contours of detected objects. An unique aggregated feature vector is formed using a fuzzy inference system by aggregating three feature vectors. To minimize computation in recognition using Hidden Markov model (HMM), the length of final feature vector is reduced using vector quantization.

abstract = {Human gait identification aims to identify people by a sequence of walking images. Comparing with fingerprint or iris based identification, the most important advantage of gait identification is that it can be done at a distance. In this paper, silhouette correlation analysis based human identification approach is proposed. By background subtracting algorithm, the moving silhouette figure can be extracted from the walking images sequence. Every pixel in the silhouette has three dimensions: horizontal axis (x), vertical axis (y), and temporal axis (t). By moving every pixel in the silhouette image along these three dimensions, we can get a new silhouette. The correlation result between the original silhouette and the new one can be used as the raw feature of human gait. Discrete Fourier transform is used to extract features from this correlation result. Then, these features are normalized to minimize the affection of noise. Primary component analysis method is used to reduce the features' dimensions. Experiment based on CASIA database shows that this method has an encouraging recognition performance.},

The human visual system is highly sensitive to biological motion and capable of extracting socially relevant information from it. Here we investigate the question of how such information is encoded in biological motion patterns and how such information can be retrieved. A framework is developed that transforms biological motion into a representation allowing for analysis using linear methods from statistics and pattern recognition. Using gender classification as an example, simple classifiers are constructed and compared to psychophysical data from human observers. The analysis reveals that the dynamic part of the motion contains more information about gender than motion-mediated structural cues. The proposed framework can be used not only for analysis of biological motion but also to synthesize new motion patterns. A simple motion modeler is presented that can be used to visualize and exaggerate the differences in male and female walking patterns.},

abstract = {We propose a view-based approach to recognize humans from their gait. Two different image features have been considered: the width of the outer contour of the binarized silhouette of the walking person and the entire binary silhouette itself. To obtain the observation vector from the image features, we employ two different methods. In the first method, referred to as the indirect approach, the high-dimensional image feature is transformed to a lower dimensional space by generating what we call the frame to exemplar (FED) distance. The FED vector captures both structural and dynamic traits of each individual. For compact and effective gait representation and recognition, the gait information in the FED vector sequences is captured in a hidden Markov model (HMM). In the second method, referred to as the direct approach, we work with the feature vector directly (as opposed to computing the FED) and train an HMM. We estimate the HMM parameters (specifically the observation probability B) based on the distance between the exemplars and the image features. In this way, we avoid learning high-dimensional probability density functions. The statistical nature of the HMM lends overall robustness to representation and recognition. The performance of the methods is illustrated using several databases.},

Gait recognition aims essentially to address this problem by identifying people based on the way they walk. In this paper, a simple but efficient gait recognition algorithm using spatial-temporal silhouette analysis is proposed. For each image sequence, a background subtraction algorithm and a simple correspondence procedure are first used to segment and track the moving silhouettes of a walking figure. Then, eigenspace transformation based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to time-varying distance signals derived from a sequence of silhouette images to reduce the dimensionality of the input feature space. Supervised pattern classification techniques are finally performed in the lower-dimensional eigenspace for recognition. This method implicitly captures the structural and transitional characteristics of gait. Extensive experimental results on outdoor image sequences demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has an encouraging recognition performance with relatively low computational cost.},

@article{Tao2007,
abstract = {The traditional image representations are not suited to conventional classification methods, such as the linear discriminant analysis (LDA), because of the under sample problem (USP): the dimensionality of the feature space is much higher than the number of training samples. Motivated by the successes of the two dimensional LDA (2DLDA) for face recognition, we develop a general tensor discriminant analysis (GTDA) as a preprocessing step for LDA. The benefits of GTDA compared with existing preprocessing methods, e.g., principal component analysis (PCA) and 2DLDA, include 1) the USP is reduced in subsequent classification by, for example, LDA; 2) the discriminative information in the training tensors is preserved; and 3) GTDA provides stable recognition rates because the alternating projection optimization algorithm to obtain a solution of GTDA converges, while that of 2DLDA does not. We use human gait recognition to validate the proposed GTDA. The averaged gait images are utilized for gait representation. Given the popularity of Gabor function based image decompositions for image understanding and object recognition, we develop three different Gabor function based image representations: 1) the GaborD representation is the sum of Gabor filter responses over directions, 2) GaborS is the sum of Gabor filter responses over scales, and 3) GaborSD is the sum of Gabor filter responses over scales and directions. The GaborD, GaborS and GaborSD representations are applied to the problem of recognizing people from their averaged gait images.A large number of experiments were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness (recognition rate) of gait recognition based on first obtaining a Gabor, GaborD, GaborS or GaborSD image representation, then using GDTA to extract features and finally using LDA for classification. The proposed methods achieved good performance for gait recognition based on image sequences from the USF HumanID Database. Experimental comparisons are made with nine state of the art classification methods in gait recognition.},

abstract = {Identification of people by analysis of gait patterns extracted from video has recently become a popular research problem. However, the conditions under which the problem is "solvable" are not understood or characterized. To provide a means for measuring progress and characterizing the properties of gait recognition, we introduce the HumanID Gait Challenge Problem. The challenge problem consists of a baseline algorithm, a set of 12 experiments, and a large data set. The baseline algorithm estimates silhouettes by background subtraction and performs recognition by temporal correlation of silhouettes. The 12 experiments are of increasing difficulty, as measured by the baseline algorithm, and examine the effects of five covariates on performance. The covariates are: change in viewing angle, change in shoe type, change in walking surface, carrying or not carrying a briefcase, and elapsed time between sequences being compared. Identification rates for the 12 experiments range from 78 percent on the easiest experiment to 3 percent on the hardest. All five covariates had statistically significant effects on performance, with walking surface and time difference having the greatest impact. The data set consists of 1,870 sequences from 122 subjects spanning five covariates (1.2 Gigabytes of data). The gait data, the source code of the baseline algorithm, and scripts to run, score, and analyze the challenge experiments are available at http://www.GaitChallenge.org. This infrastructure supports further development of gait recognition algorithms and additional experiments to understand the strengths and weaknesses of new algorithms. The more detailed the experimental results presented, the more detailed is the possible meta-analysis and greater is the understanding. It is this potential from the adoption of this challenge problem that represents a radical departure from traditional computer vision research methodology.},

problem is formulated as one of controlling the shape of the curve in
the image plane. We study the controllability of the system

approximating them by piecewise \&amp;ldquo;linear\&amp;rdquo; curvature curves.

@article{Rao1993,
abstract = {In many tracking and surveillance systems, multisensor configurations are used to provide a greater breadth of measurement information and also to increase the capability of the system to survive individual sensor failure. Most architectures currently used in such systems rely on having either a central processor where global data fusion takes place or a central communications medium through which all messages between sensors must pass. Such centralized architectures give rise to problems with communication and computational bottlenecks and are susceptible to total system failure should the central facility fail. In this article we describe a multisensor surveillance system that achieves a high degree of survivability by employing a decentralized sensing architecture (Durrant-Whyte, Rao, and Hu 1990). Using CCD cameras and optical barriers the system is able to track (in real time) people and robots as they move around a factory room. The decentralized sensing architecture takes the form of a network of Transport-based sensor nodes, each with its own processing facility, that together do not require any central processor, any central communication facility; or any common clock. In this architecture, computation is performed locally, and communication occurs between any two nodes as and when required. The starting point for the surveillance system is an algorithm that allows complete decentralization of the multisensor Kalman filter equations among a number of sensing nodes. We develop the algorithm to ensure that internodal communication is minimized and can take place without any prior synchronization between nodes. By designing a suitable track management scheme, we are able to extend the system to cope with multitarget tracking. Finally, the specific sensors used in the implementation are interfaced to the algorithm, and the results of the working system are given.},

abstract = {An important issue that arises in the automation of many security, surveillance, and reconnaissance tasks is that of observing the movements of targets navigating in a bounded area of interest. A key research issue in these problems is that of sensor placementâdetermining where sensors should be located to maintain the targets in view. In complex applications involving limited-range sensors, the use of multiple sensors dynamicallymoving over time is required. In this paper, we investigate the use of a cooperative team of autonomous sensor-based robots for the observation of multiple moving targets. In other research, analytical techniques have been developed for solving this problem in complex geometrical environments. However, these previous approaches are very computationally expensiveâat least exponential in the number of robotsâand cannot be implemented on robots operating in real- time. Thus, this paper reports on our studies of a simpler problem involving uncluttered environmentsâthose with either no obstacles or with randomly distributed simple convex obstacles. We focus primarily on developing the on-line distributed control strategies that allow the robot team to attempt to minimize the total time in which targets escape observation by some robot team member in the area of interest. This paper first formalizes the problem (which we term CMOMMT for Cooperative Multi-Robot Observation of Multiple Moving Targets) and discusses related work.We then present a distributed heuristic approach (which we call A-CMOMMT) for solving the CMOMMT problem that uses weighted local force vector control.We analyze the effectiveness of the resulting weighted force vector approach by comparing it to three other approaches. We present the results of our experiments in both simulation and on physical robots that demonstrate the superiority of the A-CMOMMT approach for situations in which the ratio of targets to robots is greater than 1/2. Finally, we conclude by proposing that the CMOMMT problem makes an excellent domain for studying multi-robot learning in inherently cooperative tasks. This approach is the first of its kind for solving the on-line cooperative observation problem and implementing it on a physical robot team.},

This article proposes a set of new algorithms and procedures for detecting and tracking mobile objects by robots that work collaboratively as part of a multirobot system. These surveillance algorithms are conceived of to work with data provided by long distance range sensors and are intended for highly reliable object detection in wide outdoor environments. Contrary to most common approaches, in which detection and tracking are done by an integrated procedure, the approach proposed here relies on a modular structure, in which detection and tracking are carried out independently, and the latter might accept input data from different detection algorithms. Two movement detection algorithms have been developed for the detection of dynamic objects by using both static and/or mobile robots. The solution to the overall problem is based on the use of a Kalman filter to predict the next state of each tracked object. Additionally, new tracking algorithms capable of combining dynamic objects lists coming from either one or various sources complete the solution. The complementary performance of the separated modular structure for detection and identification is evaluated and, finally, a selection of test examples discussed.},

abstract = {Interest in change detection techniques has considerably increased during recent years in the field of autonomous robotics. This is partly because changes in a robot's working environment are useful for several robotic skills (e.g., spatial cognition, modelling or navigation) and applications (e.g., surveillance or guidance robots). Changes are usually detected by comparing current data provided by the robot's sensors with a previously known map or model of the environment. When the data consists of a large point cloud, dealing with it is a computationally expensive task, mainly due to the amount of points and the redundancy. Using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) instead of raw point clouds leads to a more compact feature space that can be used to efficiently process the input data. This allows us to successfully segment the set of 3D points acquired by the sensor and reduce the computational load of the change detection algorithm. However, the segmentation of the environment as a Mixture of Gaussians has some problems that need to be properly addressed. In this paper, a novel change detection algorithm is described in order to improve the robustness and computational cost of previous approaches. The proposal is based on the classic Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, for which different selection criteria are evaluated. As demonstrated in the experimental results section, the proposed change detection algorithm achieves the detection of changes in the robot's working environment faster and more accurately than similar approaches.

abstract = {This paper proposes a new method for self-calibrating a set of stationary non-rotating zooming cameras. This is a realistic configuration, usually encountered in surveillance systems, in which each zooming camera is physically attached to a static structure (wall, ceiling, robot, or tripod). In particular, a linear, yet effective method to recover the affine structure of the observed scene from two or more such stationary zooming cameras is presented. The proposed method solely relies on point correspondences across images and no knowledge about the scene is required. Our method exploits the mostly translational displacement of the so-called principal plane of each zooming camera to estimate the location of the plane at infinity. The principal plane of a camera, at any given setting of its zoom, is encoded in its corresponding perspective projection matrix from which it can be easily extracted. As a displacement of the principal plane of a camera under the effect of zooming allows the identification of a pair of parallel planes, each zooming camera can be used to locate a line on the plane at infinity. Hence, two or more such zooming cameras in general positions allow the obtainment of an estimate of the plane at infinity making it possible, under the assumption of zero-skew and/or known aspect ratio, to linearly calculate the camera's parameters. Finally, the parameters of the camera and the coordinates of the plane at infinity are refined through a nonlinear least-squares optimization procedure. The results of our extensive experiments using both simulated and real data are also reported in this paper. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

RatSLAM builds a map in an online manner, driving loop closure and relocalization through sequences of familiar visual scenes. Visual ambiguity is managed by maintaining multiple competing vehicle pose estimates, while cumulative errors in odometry are corrected after loop closure by a map correction algorithm. We demonstrate the mapping performance of the system on a 66 km car journey through a complex suburban road network.

We consider visual SLAM, where the location of the camera and a map of the environment can be generated using images from a single moving camera. In visual SLAM, the interest point detector is of key importance. This detector must be invariant to certain image transformations so that features can be matched across di erent frames. Recent work has used a model of human visual attention to detect interest points, however it is unclear as to what is the best attention model for this purpose. To this aim, we compare the performance of interest points from four saliency models (Itti, GBVS, RARE, and AWS) with the performance of four traditional interest point detectors (Harris, Shi-Tomasi, SIFT, and FAST). We evaluate these detectors under several di erent types of image transformation and nd that the Itti saliency model, in general, achieves the best performance in terms of keypoint repeatability.

abstract = {This paper describes an approach to the problem of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) based on Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and using omnidirectional images. In the field of mobile robot applications, SGD techniques have never been evaluated with information gathered by visual sensors. This work proposes a SGD algorithm within a SLAM system which makes use of the beneficial characteristics of a single omnidirectional camera. The nature of the sensor has led to a modified version of the standard SGD to adapt it to omnidirectional geometry. Besides, the angular unscaled observation measurement needs to be considered. This upgraded SGD approach minimizes the non-linear effects which impair and compromise the convergence of traditional estimators. Moreover, we suggest a strategy to improve the convergence speed of the SLAM solution, which inputs several constraints in the SGD algorithm simultaneously, in contrast to former SGD approaches, which process only constraint independently. In particular, we focus on an efficient map model, established by a reduced set of image views. We present a series of experiments obtained with both simulated and real data. We validate the new SGD approach, compare the efficiency versus a standard SGD and demonstrate the suitability and the reliability of the approach to support real applications. Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Wireless technologies are becoming an essential part of our daily life. These technologies are expected to provide a wide variety of real-time applications; hence, there is a vital need to provide quality-of-Service (QoS) support. One of the key mechanisms to support QoS is traffic regulation. The basic idea behind traffic regulation is to measure the network state (e.g., load) in order to adapt the rate of carefully selected application flows. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called FuzzyWMN, which can be used to implement traffic adaptation in Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs).The objective of FuzzyWMN is to compute the rate adaptation to apply to application flows according to the current network state; it relies on two parameters to meet this objective: <formularef refid="deqn1">(1)</formularef> packet delays between sources and destinations; and <formularef refid="deqn2">(2)</formularef> buffer occupancy of network nodes. The proposed model combines the essential notions of both fuzzy logic theory and Petri nets; this enables FuzzyWMN to realize traffic adaptation in networks characterized by information uncertainty and imprecision due to the dynamic traffic behavior, channel interferences, etc. Extensive simulations show that FuzzyWMN achieves stable end-to-end delay and good throughput under different network conditions.},

For comparison purposes, the same controller design was implemented in these architectures. A Multi-state Fuzzy Logic controller (FLC) was implemented both in a Xilinx?? Virtex-II FPGA (XC2v1000) and in a soft real-time platform NI CompactRIO??-9002. The same sampling time was used. The comparative tests were conducted using a servo-pneumatic actuation system. Steady-state errors lower than 4 ??m were reached for an arbitrary vertical positioning of a 6.2 kg mass when the controller was embedded into the FPGA platform. Performance gains up to 16 times in the steady-state error, up to 27 times in the overshoot and up to 19.5 times in the settling time were achieved by using the FPGA-based controller over the software-based FLC controller. ?? 2013 ISA.},

It is based on the linguistic 2-tuples representation model, that allows the symbolic translation of a label considering an unique parameter. It involves a reduction of the search space that eases the derivation of optimal models. This work presents a new symbolic representation with three values (s, $\alpha$, $\beta$), respectively representing a label, the lateral displacement and the amplitude variation of the support of this label. Based on this new representation we propose a new method for fine tuning of membership functions that is combined with a rule base reduction method in order to extract the most useful tuned rules. This approach makes use of a modified inference system that consider non-covered inputs in order to improve the final fuzzy model generalization ability, specially in highly non-linear problems with noise points. Additionally, we analyze the proposed approach showing its behavior in two real-world applications.},

@article{Sharma2005,
abstract = {Purpose - To permit the system safety and reliability analysts to evaluate the criticality or risk associated with item failure modes. Design/methodology/approach - The factors considered in traditional failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) for risk assessment are frequency of occurrence (Sf), severity (S) and detectability (Sd) of an item failure mode. Because of the subjective and qualitative nature of the information and to make the analysis more consistent and logical, an approach using fuzzy logic is proposed. In the proposed approach, these parameters are represented as members of a fuzzy set fuzzified by using appropriate membership functions and are evaluated in fuzzy inference engine, which makes use of well-defined rule base and fuzzy logic operations to determine the criticality/riskiness level of the failure. The fuzzy conclusion is then defuzzified to get risk priority number. The higher the value of RPN, the greater will be the risk and lower the value of RPN, and the lesser will be the risk. The fuzzy linguistic assessment model was developed using toolbox platform of MATLAB 6.5 R.13. Findings - The applicability of the proposed approach is investigated with the help of an illustrative case study from the paper industry. Fuzzy risk assessment is carried out for prioritizing failure causes of the hydraulic system, a primary element of the feeding system. The results provide an alternate ranking to that obtained by the traditional method. It is concluded from the study that the fuzzy logic-based approach not only resolves the limitations associated with traditional methodology for RPN evaluation but also permits the experts to combine probability of occurrence (Sf), severity (S) and detectability (Sd) of failure modes in a more flexible and realistic manner by using their judgement, experience and expertise. Originality/value - The paper integrates the use of fuzzy logic and expert database with FMEA and may prove helpful to system safety and reliability analysts while conducting failure mode and effect analysis to prioritize failures for taking corrective or remedial actions.

To achieve this goal, an improved method of designing the fuzzy controller model is proposed that significantly reduces the time required to process the active rules and effectively increases the input data processing rate. The digital fuzzy logic controller discussed in this paper achieves an internal core processing speed of at least 200 MHz, featuring two 8-bit inputs and one 12-bit output, with up to seven trapezoidal shape membership functions per input and a rule base of up to 49 rules.

Type-1 singleton and non-singleton fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are reviewed. Type-2 FLSs, which are relatively new, and are very appropriate for signal processing problems, because they can handle linguistic and numerical uncertainties, are overviewed in some detail. The output of a type-2 FLS is a type-2 fuzzy set. Using a new operation called type-reduction, the type-2 set can be reduced to a type-1 set - the type-reduced set - which plays the role of a confidence interval for linguistic uncertainties. No such result can be obtained for a type-1 FLS. We demonstrate, by means of examples, that a type-2 FLS can outperform a type-1 FLS for one-step prediction of a Mackey-Glass chaotic time series whose measurements are corrupted by additive noise, and equalization of a nonlinear time-varying channel.},

Conventional tutorials in this area follow a fixed outline starting from the basic principles (set operations, relations, etc) and ending with current applications such as pattern recognition, information classification and system control. We argue that an iterative and concurrent top-dawn/down-top approach to learning would be more effective, and suggest that a plan to discover concepts first and map them afterwards is viable.

abstract = {A fuzzy logic system (FLS) is unique in that it is able to simultaneously handle numerical data and linguistic knowledge. It is a nonlinear mapping of an input data (feature) vector into a scalar output, i.e., it maps numbers into numbers. Fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic establish the specifics of the nonlinear mapping. This tutorial paper provides a guided tour through those aspects of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic that are necessary to synthesize an FLS. It does this by starting with crisp set theory and dual logic and demonstrating how both can be extended to their fuzzy counterparts. Because engineering systems are, for the most part, causal, we impose causality as a constraint on the development of the FLS. After synthesizing a FLS, we demonstrate that it can be expressed mathematically as a linear combination of fuzzy basis functions, and is a nonlinear universal function approximator, a property that it shares with feedforward neural networks. The fuzzy basis function expansion is very powerful because its basis functions can be derived from either numerical data or linguistic knowledge, both of which can be cast into the forms of IF-THEN rules},

Accelerator) which provides various fuzzy inference methods and fuzzy
set operations. The basic idea of this study is to develop a more
general purpose hardware system. The architecture has SIMD structure,
which consists of two parts; a system control unit (main controller),
and an arithmetic unit (fuzzy processing element (FPE)).
Microinstruction codes are defined and any fuzzy operation can be
programmed by using these microinstructions. Each FPE has the maximum
speed of 10 M FLOPS. As the KAFA contains 128 FPE's, if a fuzzy set
consists of 128 elements, we achieve the peak performance of 10 M FSOPS
(fuzzy set operation per second) under 10 MHz clock frequency. This
system also includes the parallel algorithms for defuzzification on the
SIMD mode architecture using KAFA network. The prototype of the proposed
architecture was developed with the FPGA chips. The speed of the KAFA
holds promise for the development of the new fuzzy application system

This behavioral distance provides a quantitative analogue of bisimilarity and is defined as the greatest fixed point of a suitable monotonic function. The behavioral distance has the important property that two systems are at zero distance if and only if they are bisimilar. Moreover, for any given threshold, we find that systems with behavioral distances bounded by the threshold are equivalent. In addition, we show that two system combinatorsparallel composition and product are non-expansive with respect to our behavioral distance, which makes compositional verification possible. The theory developed here is applicable to the quantitative verification, approximate reduction, and reliability analysis of fuzzy transition systems.},

abstract = {The classical fuzzy system modeling methods only consider the current scene where the training data are assumed fully collectable. However, if the available data from that scene are insufficient, the fuzzy systems trained will suffer from weak generalization for the modeling task in this scene. In order to overcome this problem, a fuzzy system with knowledge-leverage capability, which is known as a knowledge-leverage-based fuzzy system (KL-FS), is proposed in this paper. The KL-FS not only makes full use of the data from the current scene in the learning procedure but can effectively make leverage on the existing knowledge from the reference scene, e.g., the parameters of a fuzzy system obtained from a reference scene, as well. Specifically, a knowledge-leverage-based Mamdani-Larsen-type fuzzy system (KL-ML-FS) is proposed by using the reduced set density estimation technique integrating with the corresponding knowledge-leverage mechanism. The new fuzzy system modeling technique has been verified by experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, where KL-ML-FS has better performance and adaptability than the traditional fuzzy modeling methods in scenarios with insufficient data.},

In this setting, we present the definition of an interval-valued Choquet integral with respect to an admissible order based on an admissible pair of aggregation functions. The importance of the definition of the Choquet integral, which is introduced by us here, lies in the fact that if the considered data are pointwise (i.e., if they are not proper intervals), then it recovers the classical concept of this aggregation. Next, we show that if we make use of intervals in multiexpert decision making problems, then the solution at which we arrive may depend on the total order between intervals that has been chosen. For this reason, we conclude the paper by proposing two new algorithms such that the second one allows us, by means of the Shapley value, to pick up the best alternative from a set of winning alternatives provided by the first algorithm.Â© 2013 IEEE.},

The system included three main components to sense, process, and classify the traction conditions. The information received from the speed sensors is used to avoid any error that might cause service interruption and unnecessary maintenance. There are, however, occasions when these signals may not be sensed, transmitted, or received precisely due to unexpected conditions such as noise. Therefore, in this study, the \~{a}-level fuzzy Bayesian model was proposed for sensor-based traction control systems. In order to apply the fuzzy Bayesian concept, the wheel acceleration was assumed to be a fuzzy random variable for membership function with fuzzy prior distribution. Using the fuzzy signals, the intelligent model calculates the risk of classification for the system that results in determining the misclassification decision at a minimum cost. Themodel's engine involves a mathematical problem which can be solved in any programming language in onboard or embedded computers. The conceptual model was applied to a case study with promising results, which can be used for target systems or simulation. Â© 2013 IEEE.},

However, there has been little focus on parameter reduction of the interval-valued fuzzy soft sets, which is significant in decision-making problems. In this paper, we introduce four different definitions of parameter reduction in interval-valued fuzzy soft sets to satisfy different the needs of decision makers. We propose four heuristic algorithms of parameter reduction.

abstract = {This paper focuses on an optimum route search function in the in-vehicle routing guidance system. For a dynamic route guidance system (DRGS), it should provide dynamic routing advice based on real-time traffic information and traffic conditions, such as congestion and roadwork. However, considering all these situations in traditional methods makes it very difficult to identify a valid mathematical model. To realize the DRGS, this paper proposes the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) using a fuzzy inference technique based on the real-time traffic information. This AHP-FUZZY approach is a multicriterion combination system. The nature of the AHP-FUZZY approach is a pairwise comparison, which is expressed by the fuzzy inference techniques, to achieve the weights of the attributes. The hierarchy structure of the AHP-FUZZY approach can greatly simplify the definition of a decision strategy and explicitly represent the multiple criteria, and the fuzzy inference technique can handle the vagueness and uncertainty of the attributes and adaptively generate the weights for the system. Based on the AHP-FUZZY approach, a simulation system is implemented in the route guidance system, and the process is analyzed. Â© 2013 IEEE.},

Based on this general model, the exponential stability issue of the closed-loop systems with an input constraint is first investigated by a novel time-dependent Lyapunov functional, which is positive definite at sampling times but not necessary between the sampling times. Then, two sufficient conditions are developed for sampled-data fuzzy controller synthesis of the underlying T-S fuzzy model with or without input constraint. All the proposed results in this paper depend on both the upper and lower bounds on a sampling interval, and the available information about the actual sampling pattern is fully utilized. The proposed sampled-data fuzzy control scheme is successfully applied to the chaotic Lorenz system, which is shown to be effective and less conservative compared with existing results.

abstract = {In real-life applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), optimization of the network operation is required to extend its lifetime. A framework is proposed that enables practical development of centralized cluster-based protocols supported by optimization methods for the WSNs. Based on this framework, a protocol using harmony search algorithm (HSA), a music-based meta-heuristic optimization method, is designed and implemented in real time for the WSNs. It is expected to minimize the intra-cluster distances between the cluster members and their cluster heads (CHs) and optimize the energy distribution of the WSNs. The study of HSA cluster-based protocol is carried out in a real case where the WSNs equipped with the proposed protocol are deployed in an indoor environment to monitor the ambient temperature for fire detection. A comparison is made with the well-known cluster-based protocols developed for WSNs such as low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy-centralized (LEACH-C) and a cluster-based protocol using Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed protocol using HSA can be realized in centralized cluster-based WSNs for safety and surveillance applications in building environments. From the obtained experimental test results, it can be seen that the WSNs lifetime has been extended using the proposed HSA protocol in comparison with that of LEACH-C and FCM protocols.},

This design flow is supported by specific tools for fuzzy systems development and standard FPGA synthesis and implementation tools, which use the modeling and simulation facilities provided by the Matlab environment.

An equivalent control law is firstly designed based on a nominal system model that was obtained by using curve fitting techniques under MATLAB. Switching control is then added to guarantee that the state reaches the sliding surface in the presence of parameter and disturbance uncertainties. Also, fuzzy tuning schemes, which can be supported by learning techniques derived from neural networks, are employed to improve control performance and to reduce chattering in the sliding mode. To verify the performance of this controller, an experimental platform of a pneumatically actuated top-guided single-seated control valve, which belongs to a classical complex nonlinear system, was constructed. Also, the experimental results show that high performance and attenuated chatter are achieved and thus verify the validity of the proposed control approach to dynamic systems characterized by severe uncertainties.

The second MPPT algorithm controls the power converter between the PV panel and the load and implements a new fuzzy-logic (FLC)-based perturb and observe (P\&amp;O) scheme to keep the system power operating point at its maximum. The FLC-MPPT is based on a voltage control approach of the power converter with a discrete PI controller to adapt the duty cycle. The input reference voltage is adaptively perturbed with variable steps until the maximum power is reached. The proposed control scheme achieves stable operation in the entire region of the PV panel and eliminates therefore the resulting oscillations around the maximum power operating point.

abstract = {Modeling of manufacturing processes is important because it enables manufacturers to understand the process behavior and determine the optimum operating conditions of the process for a high yield, low cost and robust operation. However, existing techniques in modeling manufacturing processes cannot address the whole common issues in developing models for manufacturing processes: a) manufacturing processes are usually nonlinear in nature; b) a small amount of experimental data is only available for developing manufacturing process models; c) outliers often exist in experimental data; d) explicit models in a polynomial form are often preferred by manufacturing process engineers; and e) models with satisfactory prediction accuracy are required. In this paper, a modeling algorithm, namely, the particle swarm optimization-based fuzzy regression (PSO-FR) approach, is proposed to generate fuzzy nonlinear regression models, which seek to address all of the common issues in developing models for manufacturing processes. The PSO-FR first employs the operations of particle swarm optimization to generate the structures of the process models in nonlinear polynomial form, and then it employs a fuzzy coefficient generator to identify outliers in the original experimental data. Fuzzy coefficients of the process models are determined by the fuzzy coefficient generator in which the experimental data excluding the outliers is used. The effectiveness of the PSO-FR approach is evaluated by modeling the manufacturing process liquid epoxy molding process which is a commonly used technology for microchip encapsulation in electronic packaging. Results were compared with those based on the commonly used modeling methods. It was found that PSO-FR can achieve better goodness-of-fitness than other methods. Also, the prediction accuracy of the model developed based on the PSO-FR is better than the other methods.},

Many problems must be faced: adaptivity, hybrid control strategies, system (hardware) integration, and ubiquitous networking access. In this paper, a solution that attempts to provide a flexible and dependable solution to these complicated problems is illustrated. First, an extensible markup language (XML)-derived technologies is proposed to define fuzzy markup language (FML), a markup language skilled for defining detailed structure of fuzzy control independent from its legacy representation. FML is essentially composed of three layers: 1) XML in order to create a new markup language for fuzzy logic control; 2) document type definition in order to define the legal building blocks; and 3) extensible stylesheet language transformations in order to convert a fuzzy controller description into a specific programming language. Then an agent-based framework designed for providing proactive services in domotic environments, is presented. The agent architecture, exploiting mobile computation, is able to maximize the fuzzy control deployment for the natively FML representation by performing an efficient distribution of pieces of the global control flow over the different computers. Agents are also used to capture user habits, to identify requests, and to apply the artefact-mediated activity through an adaptive fuzzy control strategy. The architecture adopts interoperability techniques that, combined with sophisticated control facilities, represent an efficient experience for adaptive domotic framework.},

The control scheme includes three kinds of fuzzy controls which are the fuzzy balanced standing control (FBSC), the fuzzy traveling and position control (FTPC), and the fuzzy yaw steering control (FYSC). Based on the Takagi\&\#x2013;Sugeno fuzzy model of the TWIP, the FBSC is a structure of a parallel distributed compensator solved by the linear matrix inequality approach. Based on the motion characteristic of the TWIP, the FTPC and the FYSC are designed with Mamdani architecture if-then rules. Furthermore, the fuzzy control scheme for the real TWIP is implemented into an SoPC development board with an embedded reduced-instruction-set-computer soft-core processor and user intellectual property modules. Both the computer simulations and practical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a type-2 self-organizing neural fuzzy system (T2SONFS) and its hardware implementation. The antecedent parts in each T2SONFS fuzzy rule are interval type-2 fuzzy sets, and the consequent part is of Mamdani type. Using interval type-2 fuzzy sets in T2SONFS enables it to be more robust than type-1 fuzzy systems. T2SONFS learning consists of structure and parameter identification. For structure identification, an online clustering algorithm is proposed to generate rules automatically and flexibly distribute them in the input space. For parameter identification, a rule-ordered Kalman filter algorithm is proposed to tune the consequent-part parameters. The learned T2SONFS is hardware implemented, and implementation techniques are proposed to simplify the complex computation process of a type-2 fuzzy system. The T2SONFS is applied to nonlinear system identification and truck backing control problems with clean and noisy training data. Comparisons between type-1 and type-2 neural fuzzy systems verify the learning ability and robustness of the T2SONFS. The learned T2SONFS is hardware implemented in a field-programmable gate array chip to verify functionality of the designed circuits.},

abstract = {An ant colony optimization (ACO) application to a fuzzy controller (FC) design, called ACO-FC, is proposed in this paper for improving design efficiency and control performance, as well as ACO hardware implementation. An FC's antecedent part, i.e., the "if"part of its composing fuzzy if-then rules, is partitioned in grid-type, and all candidate rule consequent values are then listed. An ant trip is regarded as a combination of consequent values selected from every rule. A pheromone matrix among all candidate consequent values is constructed. Searching for the best one among all combinations of rule consequent values is based mainly on the pheromone matrix. The proposed ACO-FC performance is shown to be better than other metaheuristic design methods on simulation examples. The ACO used in ACO-FC is based on the known ant colony system and is hardware implemented on a field-programmable gate array chip. The ACO chip application to fuzzy control of a simulated water bath temperature control problem has verified the designed chip effectiveness. Â© 2008 IEEE.},

Therefore, this study presents a speed control integrated circuit (IC) for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive under this SoPC environment. First, the mathematic model of PMSM is defined and the vector control used in the current loop of PMSM drive is explained. Then, an adaptive fuzzy controller adopted to cope with the dynamic uncertainty and external load effect in the speed loop of PMSM drive is proposed. After that, an FPGA-based speed control IC is designed to realize the controllers. The proposed speed control IC has two IPs, a Nios II embedded processor IP and an application IP. The Nios II processor is used to develop the adaptive fuzzy controller in software due to the complicated control algorithm and low sampling frequency control (speed control: 2 kHz). The designed application IP is utilized to implement the current vector controller in hardware owing to the requirement for high sampling frequency control (current loop: 16 kHz, pulsewidth modulation circuit: 4-8 MHz) but simple computation. Finally, an experimental system is set up and some experimental results are demonstrated.},

abstract = {An embedded hybrid Hinfin adaptive fuzzy control structure is implemented for trajectory tracking control of a brushless servo drive system. The control structure employs a fuzzy logic controller incorporating an Hinfin tracking controller via an acceleration feedback signal. The fuzzy logic controller is equipped with an adaptive-law-based Lyapunov synthesis approach to compensate for system uncertainty and random changes in the external load acting on the drive system. The proposed control structure is experimentally verified on a state-of-the-art dSPACE DS1104 digital signal processor (DSP)-based data acquisition and control system in a laboratory 1-hp brushless drive system. The controllers are first designed in Simulink. Then, the Real-Time Workshop is used to automatically generate optimized C code for real-time applications. Afterward, the interface between MATLAB/Simulink and the dSPACE DS 1104 allows the control algorithm to run on the hardware processor of the DSP. The result is a powerful testbed for the rapid design and implementation of the hybrid tracking controllers for a wide variety of operating conditions. Experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller. Considerable improvement in the performance generated by the hybrid controller is compared with the traditional Hinfin controller},

abstract = {<?Pub Dtl?>This paper presents a novel scheme called \&\#x201C;Laboratory Testbed for Embedded Fuzzy Control of a Real Time Nonlinear System.\&\#x201D; The idea is based upon the fact that project-based learning motivates students to learn actively and to use their engineering skills acquired in their previous years of study. It also fosters initiative and focuses students' attention on authentic real-world problems. At the same time, it enhances their learning. Students gain hands-on experience and improve their skills in product development, self-directed learning, teamwork, and project management. There has been a tremendous rise in the popularity of intelligent control techniques like fuzzy logic for use in industrial control applications in recent times. These techniques, which were primarily conceived for nonlinear control applications, are best implemented using embedded controllers, which can use their capabilities to the maximum. While courses in electrical and computer engineering cover several areas like digital and analog integrated circuits, microprocessors and control Systems, and process control, few of these integrate all these areas with focus on the application of intelligent techniques in real-time systems. Also, there is a growing need in industry for engineers who can perform software design and system integration for various applications in embedded control. This paper aims at developing such a practical task as one of the major projects in the eighth semester of the program offered by the Instrumentation and Control Engineering (ICE) Department of Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology (NSIT), Delhi University, India, to design a real-time embedded controller implementing an intelligent control technique, fuzzy logic, for control applications. These applications might, for example, be level control, flow control, or pressure control. The paper discusses an example of a real-time pressure control system for which a microcontroller-based fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller has been simulated and implemented with satisfactory results.},

abstract = {The Permanent Magnet Synchronous motor is a rotating electrical machine where the stator produces a sinusoidal flux density distribution in the air gap and the rotor has permanent magnets. A substantial air gap magnetic flux generated by permanent magnet makes it reliable to design highly efficient motors. However, the main disadvantage is the non-uniform variance in the developed torque. These torque ripples causes speed oscillations and vibrations and perverts the system performance. Since the construction of permanent magnet synchronous motor lacks rotor coil which will provide mechanical damping during transient conditions, these motors are inefficient with open-loop V/Hz control and rely on Vector Control for better dynamic response. Fuzzy logic controllers which does not requires any modeling of a system based on mathematics and are they are working on the linguistic rules. It also improves the performance of PI controllers which are affected by load turbulence, parameter variations and speed disturbances. This project presents the Fuzzy logic approach for a vector controlled PMSM drive for minimizing torque ripples. Also, Space vector modulation is employed to overcome the periodic torque pulsations generated by hysteresis controllers. The design analysis and the hardware control are implemented by using FPGA controller and discussions on the hardware results are done. Â© 2005 - 2014 JATIT \& LLS. All rights reserved.},

The WC is found to be able to react to the environment appropriately during its navigation to avoid crashing with obstacles by turning to the proper angle while moving. To design the controller unit, a speed sensor and a distance sensor, etc. are placed in front of the wheelchair for its functionality. The numerous data is used to evaluate the algorithm which control an output signal for the brake-power using by the input signals of speed sensor and distance sensor. The FLC has proven a commendable solution in dealing with certain control problems when the situation is ambiguous. One of the main difficulties faced by conventional control systems is the inability to operate in a condition with incomplete and imprecise information. As the complexity of a situation increases, a traditional mathematical model will be difficult to implement. Fuzzy logic is a tool for modeling uncertain systems by facilitating common sense reasoning in decision-making in the absence of complete and precise information. In this study, the WC is designed based on the theories of fuzzy logic (such as fuzzifier, fuzzy rule base, inference mechanism and defuzzifier) and then simulated in MATLAB platform. The designed codes of WC also have written in VFfDL language for implementing the hardware blocks of the separate modules of the WC. The verified VHDL code of the WC has been synthesized using Quarrus II tool in Altera environment.

abstract = {A general method is developed to generate fuzzy rules from
numerical data. The method consists of five steps: divide the input and
output spaces of the given numerical data into fuzzy regions; generate
fuzzy rules from the given data; assign a degree of each of the
generated rules for the purpose of resolving conflicts among the
generated rules; create a combined fuzzy rule base based on both the
generated rules and linguistic rules of human experts; and determine a
mapping from input space to output space based on the combined fuzzy
rule base using a defuzzifying procedure. The mapping is proved to be
capable of approximating any real continuous function on a compact set
to arbitrary accuracy. Applications to truck backer-upper control and
time series prediction problems are presented},

abstract = {A grey-prediction self-organizing fuzzy controller (GPSOFC) has been proposed to control robotic systems. It solves the problems caused by the inappropriate selection of parameters in a self-organizing fuzzy controller (SOFC) and eliminates the dynamic coupling effects between degrees of freedom (DOFs) in robotic systems. However, its stability is difficult to demonstrate. To overcome the stability issue, this study developed an enhanced adaptive grey-prediction self-organizing fuzzy sliding-mode controller (EAGSFSC) for robotic systems. The EAGSFSC not only solves the problem of a GPSOFC implementation by determining the stability of the system but also applies an adaptive law to modify the fuzzy consequent parameter of a fuzzy logic controller for manipulating a robotic system to improve its control performance. The stability of the EAGSFSC was proven using the Lyapunov stability theorem. To confirm the suitability of the proposed method, this study applied the EAGSFSC to manipulate a 6-DOF robot to determine its control performance. Experimental results showed that the EAGSFSC achieved better control performance than the GPSOFC as well as the SOFC for robotic motion control. Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents an improved fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) for high-performance industrial drive applications. In the proposed control scheme for high-speed operations above the rated speed, the operating limits of IPMSM are expanded by incorporating the maximum torque per ampere operation in constant torque region and the flux-weakening operation in constant power region. The power ratings of the motor and the inverter are considered in developing the control algorithm. A new and simple FLC is utilized as a speed controller. The FLC is developed to have less computational burden, which makes it suitable for real-time implementation, particularly at high-speed operating conditions. The complete drive is implemented in real-time using digital signal processor (DSP) controller board DS 1102 on a laboratory 1-hp IPM motor. The efficiency of the proposed control scheme is evaluated through both experimental and computer simulation results. The proposed controller is found to be robust for high-speed applications},

The fundamentals of fuzzy logic algorithms as related to motor control applications are illustrated. A simplified fuzzy speed controller for the IPMSM drive has been found to maintain high performance standards with a much simpler and less computation-intensive implementation than a nonsimplified fuzzy-based algorithm. Contrary to the conventional control of IPMSM with d-axis current equal to zero, a nonlinear expression of d-axis current has been derived and subsequently incorporated in the control algorithm for maximum torque operation. The efficacy of the proposed simplified fuzzy-logic-controller (FLC)-based IPMSM drive with MTPA is verified by simulation as well as experimentally at dynamic operating conditions. The simplified FLC with MTPA is found to be robust for applications in IPMSM drives. The complete vector control scheme is implemented in real-time using a digital signal processor (DSP) controller board DS 1102 in a laboratory 1-hp IPM synchronous motor.},
